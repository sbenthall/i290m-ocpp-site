    abstract = {{Users share massive amounts of personal information and opinion with each other and different service providers every day. In such an interconnected setting, the privacy of individual users is bound to be affected by the decisions of others, giving rise to the phenomenon which we term as interdependent privacy. In this paper we define online privacy interdependence, show its existence through a study of Facebook application permissions, and model its impact through an Interdependent Privacy Game (IPG). We show that the arising negative externalities can steer the system into equilibria which are inefficient for both users and platform vendor. We also discuss how the underlying incentive misalignment, the absence of risk signals and low user awareness contribute to unfavorable outcomes.}},

@article{naci2013,
    abstract = {{The interpretation of human thought from brain activity, without recourse to speech or action, is one of the most provoking and challenging frontiers of modern neuroscience. In particular, patients who are fully conscious and awake, yet, due to brain damage, are unable to show any behavioral responsivity, expose the limits of the neuromuscular system and the necessity for alternate forms of communication. Although it is well established that selective attention can significantly enhance the neural representation of attended sounds, it remains, thus far, untested as a response modality for brain-based communication. We asked whether its effect could be reliably used to decode answers to binary (yes/no) questions. Fifteen healthy volunteers answered questions (e.g.,  ” Do you have brothers or sisters?”) in the fMRI scanner, by selectively attending to the appropriate word ( ” yes” or  ” no”). Ninety percent of the answers were decoded correctly based on activity changes within the attention network. The majority of volunteers conveyed their answers with less than 3 min of scanning, suggesting that this technique is suited for communication in a reasonable amount of time. Formal comparison with the current best-established fMRI technique for binary communication revealed improved individual success rates and scanning times required to detect responses. This novel fMRI technique is intuitive, easy to use in untrained participants, and reliably robust within brief scanning times. Possible applications include communication with behaviorally nonresponsive patients.}},

    abstract = {{Much of the widespread poverty, environmental desecration, and waste of human life seen around the globe could be prevented by known (to humanity as a whole) technologies, many of which are simply not available to those that need it. This lack of access to critical information for sustainable development is directly responsible for a morally and ethically unacceptable level of human suffering and death. A solution to this general problem is the concept of open source appropriate technology or OSAT, which refers to technologies that provide for sustainable development while being designed in the same fashion as free and open source software. OSAT is made up of technologies that are easily and economically utilized from readily available resources by local communities to meet their needs and must meet the boundary conditions set by environmental, cultural, economic, and educational resource constraints of the local community. This paper explores both the open source and appropriate technology aspects of OSAT to create a paradigm, in which anyone can both learn how to make and use needed technologies free of intellectual property concerns. At the same time, anyone can also add to the collective open source knowledge ecosystem or knowledge commons by contributing ideas, designs, observations, experimental data, deployment logs, etc. It is argued that if OSAT continues to grow and takes hold globally creating a vibrant virtual community to share technology plans and experiences, a new technological revolution built on a dispersed network of innovators working together to create a just sustainable world is possible.}},

Nonetheless, our knowledge of its deployment outside the software industry is very limited. This paper focuses on the open source development of tangible objects, the so-called open design. We propose a generalised definition of open source development. Drawing on 27 exploratory interviews and six comparative case studies selected from a pool of more than 75 projects, we analyse the workings of open design. The analysis reveals that open design is already being implemented in a substantial variety of projects with different organisational and institutional structures.}},

Wikipedia was created through a tremendous number of contributions by millions of contributors. However, recent research has shown that the number of active contributors in Wikipedia has been declining steadily for years and suggests that a sharp decline in the retention of newcomers is the cause. This article presents data that show how several changes the Wikipedia community made to manage quality and consistency in the face of a massive growth in participation have ironically crippled the very growth they were designed to manage. Specifically, the restrictiveness of the encyclopedia's primary quality control mechanism and the algorithmic tools used to reject contributions are implicated as key causes of decreased newcomer retention. Furthermore, the community's formal mechanisms for norm articulation are shown to have calcified against changes—especially changes proposed by newer editors.}},

We need better explanatory and prescriptive models of the nature and value of information hiding. We evaluate the potential of a new theory---developed to account for the influence of modularity on the evolution of the computer industry---to inform software design. The theory uses design structure matrices to model designs and real options techniques to value them. To test the potential utility of the theory for software we apply it to Parnas's KWIC designs. We contribute an extension to design structure matrices, and we show that the options results are consistent with Parnas's conclusions. Our results suggest that such a theory does have potential to help inform software design.}},

dependencies, the conditional analysis and the multivariate modeling of
extreme data. Parts I–III about the basic extreme value methodology remain
unchanged to some larger extent, yet notable are, e.g., the new sections about
"An Overview of Reduced-Bias Estimation" (co-authored by M.I. Gomes), "The
Spectral Decomposition Methodology", and "About Tail Independence" (co-
authored by M. Frick), and the new chapter about "Extreme Value Statistics of

    abstract = {{We present a generic yet practical framework for assessing security risks to cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Our framework can be used to benchmark security risks when information is less than perfect, and interdependencies of physical and computational components may result in correlated failures. Such environments are prone to externalities, and can cause huge societal losses. We focus on the risks that arise from interdependent reliability failures (faults) and security failures (attacks). We advocate that a sound assessment of these risks requires explicit modeling of the effects of both technology-based defenses and institutions necessary for supporting them. Thus, we consider technology-based security defenses grounded in information security tools and fault-tolerant control in conjunction with institutional structures. Our game-theoretic approach to estimating security risks facilitates more effective defenses, especially against correlated failures.}},

The discussion began and this paper follows with a broad study of identity theft, at times compared with traditional payment fraud, and continues with an evaluation of its overall risk to consumers, merchants, and credit providers. The paper compares the incentives each such party has to address identity theft in concert with current market response to the crime.

    abstract = {{Communication about social topics is abundant in human societies, and many functions have been attributed to such gossiping. One of these proposed functions is the management of reputations. Reputation by itself has been shown to have a strong influence on cooperation dynamics in games of indirect reciprocity, and this notion helps to explain the observed high level of cooperation in humans. Here we designed a game to test a widespread assumption that gossip functions as a vector for the transmission of social information. This empirical study (with 14 groups of nine students each) focuses on the composition of gossip, information transfer by gossip, and the behavior based on gossip information. We show that gossip has a strong influence on the resulting behavior even when participants have access to the original information (i.e., direct observation) as well as gossip about the same information. Thus, it is evident that gossip has a strong manipulative potential. Furthermore, gossip about cooperative individuals is more positive than gossip about uncooperative individuals, gossip comments transmit social information successfully, and cooperation levels are higher when people encounter positive compared with negative gossip.}},

To gain a deeper understanding of how to be effective in such a partially competitive and partially cooperative environment, a computer tournament was conducted for the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Decision rules were submitted by entrants who were recruited primarily from experts in game theory from a variety of disciplines: psychology, political science, economics, sociology, and mathematics. The results of the tournament demonstrate that there are subtle reasons for an individualistic pragmatist to cooperate as long as the other side does, to be somewhat for-giving, and to be optimistic about the other side's responsiveness.}},

@article{cederman2011,
    abstract = {{Drawing on Clausewitz's classical theory, we argue that the emergence of mass nationalism following the French Revolution profoundly altered the nature of the units constituting the interstate system, thereby transforming the conduct of interstate warfare. To validate these assertions—and thus to test Clausewitz—we rely on quantitative evidence at the macro level, with a particular focus on the global distribution of interstate war sizes, measured in terms of battle deaths, over the past five centuries. Drawing on extreme value theory, we demonstrate that temporal discontinuities in the shapes of the tails of such distributions can be used to draw inferences about the nature of the mechanisms underlying the bloodiest events in world history. This approach allows us to show that the interstate system experienced a fundamental shift in the mechanisms underlying the production of war sizes: a shift that can be dated to the years 1770–1810, and that resulted in a systematic increase in war severity. These same tools also allow us to rule out a number of alternative explanations for this shift (including changes in population sizes and changes in weapons technology), while providing evidence for a specific account of war severity rooted in the mobilizational capacities of states.}},

The law shows that earthquakes occur in hierarchical correlated clusters, which overlap with other spatially separated correlated clusters for large enough time periods and areas.

The law links together the Gutenberg–Richter Law, the Omori Law of aftershocks, and the fractal dimensions of the faults.

    abstract = {{Many natural and social systems are characterized by bursty dynamics, for which past events trigger future activity. These systems can be modelled by so-called self-excited Hawkes conditional Poisson processes. It is generally assumed that all events have similar triggering abilities. However, some systems exhibit heterogeneity and clusters with possibly different intra- and inter-triggering, which can be accounted for by generalization into the  ” multivariate” self-excited Hawkes conditional Poisson processes. We develop the general formalism of the multivariate moment generating function for the cumulative number of first-generation and of all generation events triggered by a given mother event (the  ” shock”) as a function of the current time t. This corresponds to studying the response function of the process. A variety of different systems have been analyzed. In particular, for systems in which triggering between events of different types proceeds through a one-dimension directed or symmetric chain of influence in type space, we report a novel hierarchy of intermediate asymptotic power law decays ∼ 1/t

The present hardcover volume, originally sponsored by The RAND Corporation, was the first systematic and comprehensive treatment of a theory of mathematical models for the development of populations whose members reproduce and die, subject to laws of change. Beginning with the classical Galton-Watson model for the propagation of a family of objects all of one type, the author then extends the theory of objects of several types and to objects described by continuous variables. He next applies the theory to one of the simpler mathematical models for neutron chain reactions. Succeeding chapters treat Markov branching processes with a continuous time parameter and age-dependent branching processes. The last chapter gives the mathematical theory of electron-photo cascades, one of the components of cosmic radiation.

    abstract = {For any branching process, we demonstrate that the typical total number
\$r\_{\rm mp}(\nu \tau)\$ of events triggered over all generations within any
sufficiently large time window \$\tau\$ exhibits, at criticality, a super-linear
dependence \$r\_{\rm mp}(\nu \tau) \sim (\nu \tau)^\gamma\$ (with \$\gamma >1\$) on
the total number \$\nu \tau\$ of the immigrants arriving at the Poisson rate
\$\nu\$. In branching processes in which immigrants (or sources) are
characterized by fertilities distributed according to an asymptotic power law
tail with tail exponent \$1 < \gamma \leqslant 2\$, the exponent of the
super-linear law for \$r\_{\rm mp}(\nu \tau)\$ is identical to the exponent
\$\gamma\$ of the distribution of fertilities. For \$\gamma>2\$ and for standard
branching processes without power law distribution of fertilities, \$r\_{\rm
mp}(\nu \tau) \sim (\nu \tau)^2\$. This novel scaling law replaces and tames the
divergence \$\nu \tau/(1-n)\$ of the mean total number \${\bar R}\_t(\tau)\$ of
events, as the branching ratio (defined as the average number of triggered
events of first generation per source) tends to 1. The derivation uses the
formalism of generating probability functions. The corresponding prediction is
confirmed by numerical calculations and an heuristic derivation enlightens its
underlying mechanism. We also show that \${\bar R}\_t(\tau)\$ is always linear in
\$\nu \tau\$ even at criticality (\$n=1\$). Our results thus illustrate the
fundamental difference between the mean total number, which is controlled by a
few extremely rare realizations, and the typical behavior represented by
\$r\_{\rm mp}(\nu \tau)\$.},

    abstract = {{Practitioners have expressed concern over their inability to accurately estimate costs associated with software development. This concern has become even more pressing as costs associated with development continue to increase. As a result, considerable research attention is now directed at gaining a better understanding of the software-development process as well as constructing and evaluating software cost estimating tools. This paper evaluates four of the most popular algorithmic models used to estimate software costs (SLIM, COCOMO, Function Points, and ESTIMACS). Data on 15 large completed business data-processing projects were collected and used to test the accuracy of the models' ex post effort estimation. One important result was that Albrecht's Function Points effort estimation model was validated by the independent data provided in this study [3]. The models not developed in business data-processing environments showed significant need for calibration. As models of the software-development process, all of the models tested failed to sufficiently reflect the underlying factors affecting productivity. Further research will be required to develop understanding in this area.}},

The most critical resource for knowledge teams is expertise, or specialized skills and knowledge, but the mere presence of expertise on a team is insufficient to produce high-quality work. Expertise must be managed and coordinated in order to leverage its potential. That is, teams must be able to manage their skill and knowledge interdependencies effectively through expertise coordination, which entails knowing where expertise is located, knowing where expertise is needed, and bringing needed expertise to bear. This study investigates the importance of expertise coordination through a cross-sectional investigation of 69 software development teams. The analysis reveals that expertise coordination shows a strong relationship with team performance that remains significant over and above team input characteristics, presence of expertise, and administrative coordination.}},

Data for rates of xylem transport as a function of stem diameter show that rates of resource use in individual plants scale as approximately the 3/4 power of body mass, which is the same as metabolic rates of animals4, 5, 6, 7. Here we use this relationship to develop a mechanistic model for relationships between density and mass in resource-limited plants. It predicts that average plant size should scale as the -4/3 power of maximum population density, in agreement with empirical evidence and comparable relationships in animals5,6,8, but significantly less than the -3/2 power predicted by geometric models1. Our model implies that fundamental constraints on metabolic rate are reflected in the scaling of population density and other ecological and evolutionary phenomena, including the finding that resource allocation among species in ecosystems is independent of body size5,6,8.}},

This article re-examines her data in the light of two models which propose that the difference in quality of solution between group and individual performance is solely a matter of ability. It is shown that Shaw's data may be considered to have been an outcome of behavior postulated by the models. Since Shaw's observations relate to a special population and to special kinds of problems, the proposed models may not be appropriate under differing experimental conditions. In fact, Lorgeet al. (4) have indicated that experimental demonstration of the superiority of groups over individuals in problem-solving depends not only on the kind of group but also on the kind of problem to be solved.

Research is increasingly done in teams across nearly all fields. Teams typically produce more frequently cited research than individuals do, and this advantage has been increasing over time. Teams now also produce the exceptionally high-impact research, even where that distinction was once the domain of solo authors. These results are detailed for sciences and engineering, social sciences, arts and humanities, and patents, suggesting that the process of knowledge creation has fundamentally changed.}},

Network connections introduce the possibility of cascading failures due to an exogenous or endogenous attack depending on the profile of security investments by the agents. The general presumption in the literature, based on intuitive arguments or analysis of symmetric networks, is that because security investments create positive externalities on other agents, there will be underinvestment in security. We show that this reasoning is incomplete because of a first-order economic force: security investments are also strategic substitutes. In a general (non-symmetric) network, this implies that underinvestment by some agents will encourage overinvestment by others. We demonstrate by means of examples that there can be overinvestment by some agents and also that aggregate probabilities of infection can be lower in equilibrium compared to the social optimum. We then provide sufficient conditions for underinvestment. This requires both sufficiently convex cost functions (convexity alone is not enough) and networks that are either symmetric or locally tree-like. We also characterize the impact of network structure on equilibrium and optimal investments. Finally, we show that when the attack location is endogenized (by assuming that the attacker chooses a probability distribution over the location of the attack in order to maximize damage), there is an additional incentive for overinvestment: greater investment by an agent shifts the attack to other parts of the network.}},

The article focuses on studies in which the dependent variables are concerned with various dimensions of effectiveness. A heuristic framework illustrating recent trends in the literature depicts team effectiveness as a function of task, group, and organization design factors, environmental factors, internal processes, external processes, and group psychosocial traits. The review discusses four types of teams: work, parallel, project, and management. We review research findings for each type of team organized by the categories in our heuristic framework. The article concludes by comparing the variables studied for the different types of teams, highlighting the progress that has been made, suggesting what still needs to be done, summarizing key leamings from the last six years, and suggesting areas for further research.}},

We show that the theory of plasma oscillations is a simple nonrelativistic example exhibiting all of the features of Schwinger's idea. It is also shown that Schwinger's criterion that the vector field m≠0 implies that the matter spectrum before including the Yang-Mills interaction contains m=0, but that the example of superconductivity illustrates that the physical spectrum need not. Some comments on the relationship between these ideas and the zero-mass difficulty in theories with broken symmetries are given.}},

    abstract = {{It is commonly assumed that functional brain connectivity reflects structural brain connectivity. The exact relationship between structure and function, however, might not be straightforward. In this review we aim to examine how our understanding of the relationship between structure and function in the 'resting' brain has advanced over the last several years. We discuss eight articles that directly compare resting-state functional connectivity with structural connectivity and three clinical case studies of patients with limited white matter connections between the cerebral hemispheres. All studies examined show largely convergent results: the strength of resting-state functional connectivity is positively correlated with structural connectivity strength. However, functional connectivity is also observed between regions where there is little or no structural connectivity, which most likely indicates functional correlations mediated by indirect structural connections (i.e. via a third region). As the methodologies for measuring structural and functional connectivity continue to improve and their complementary strengths are applied in parallel, we can expect important advances in our diagnostic and prognostic capacities in diseases like Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.}},

The crews performed real military tasks in a military field setting, and unit commanders ranked the effectiveness of their performance at the end of 2 months of military activity (208 crews in all). It was found that both ability and motivation had an additive effect on crew performance. In addition, crew composition effects were found for ability but not for motivation. Most significant was the fact that the performance of uniformly high-ability crews far exceeded the levels expected on the basis of individual crew members' ability, whereas the performance of uniformly low-ability crews fell considerably below the expected level. It was concluded that when crews perform highly interdependent tasks, performance is also likely to be affected in a nonadditive manner by crew composition. The implications of the findings for crew formation are discussed.}},

@book{mitnick2003,
    abstract = {{\_The Art of Deception\_ is about gaining someone's trust by lying to them and
then abusing that trust for fun and profit. Hackers use the euphemism "social
engineering" and hacker-guru Kevin Mitnick examines many example scenarios.

After Mitnick's first dozen examples anyone responsible for organisational
security is going to lose the will to live. It's been said before but people
and security are antithetical. Organisations exist to provide a good or
service and want helpful friendly employees to promote the good or service.
People are social animals who want to be liked. Controlling the human aspects
of security means denying someone something. This circle can't be squared.

Considering Mitnick's reputation as a hacker guru the least and last point of
attack for hackers using social engineering are computers. Most of the
scenarios in \_The Art of Deception\_ work just as well against computer-free
organisations and were probably known to the Pheonicians. Technology simply
makes it all easier. Phones are faster than letters after all and large
organisations mean dealing with lots of strangers.

Much of Mitnick's security advice sounds practical until you think about
implementation, when you realise more effective security means reducing
organisational efficiency: an impossible trade in competitive business. And
anyway, who wants to work in an organisation where the rule is "Trust no one"?
Mitnick shows how easily security is breached by trust, but without trust
people can't live and work together. In the real world effective organisations
have to acknowledge total security is a chimera--and carry more insurance.

    abstract = {{Open source software development is becoming always more relevant. Understanding the behavior of developers in open source software projects and identifying the kinds of their contributions is an essential step to improve the efficiency of the development process and to organize the development teams more effectively. Moreover, understanding the level of participation of the different developers helps to understand which members of the development team are more important than others and who are the actual key developers. This paper investigates the behavior of open source developers and the structure of the development of open source projects through the analysis of a very large dataset: 10 well-known and widely used open source software projects for a total of more than 4 MLOC (millions of lines of code) modified distributed in more than 200 K versions. This study builds on the top of other studies in this area applying a set of rigorous statistical techniques, analyzing how developers contribute to the projects. Its novelty is in the fine gain analysis of the developers that have commit rights on the repository of the project they work on, in the automated identification of key contributors of the project, in the size of the analyzed datasets, and in the statistical techniques used to classify the behavior of the developers in an automated way. To collect such large volume of data and to ensure their integrity, a tool to automatically mine open source version control systems has been used. The main result of this study is the identification of a recurrent pattern of four kinds of contributors with the same characteristics in all the projects analyzed even if the projects are very different in domain, size, language, etc.}},

Open-ended comments were used to illustrate the Likert-scaled items and open-ended questions allowed respondents to express their reasons for participating in these open source communities. Results indicate that the open source contributors (n = 110, 38 paid to work on OSS projects and 72 volunteers) are motivated primarily by a sense of altruism as well as the desire to create and learn. Payment did not significantly impact the reasons for contributing to OSS projects. The comments and open-ended questions validated the findings and indicated that building a  ” Utopian” community – the desire to help for the greater good worldwide – is one of the most important motivators. Also, respondents revealed that they join and persist as members of open source communities because they enjoy the freedom to create and share free software, tools and knowledge with others inside and outside the community.}},

    abstract = {{We study how organization emerges from interdependent problem solving behavior of participants in an open production system. We consider individual problem solving attempts as acts of production embedded in an evolving bipartite network which affiliates organizational participants to organizational problems. We document how local configurations of network ties (or motifs) linking participants to problems emerge from – but at the same time sustain decentralized problem solving activities. Structural characteristics of the observed network suggest specific dependence hypotheses linking participants to problems. We explore these hypotheses by examining problem solving attempts performed by 135 participants in an open source software project on the 719 problems (software bugs) recorded during a complete release cycle of the software. Our empirical strategy relies on the specification and estimation of newly derived stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOM) originally conceived for the analysis of social networks. We find that individual problem solving behavior is activated by the interaction between local configurations of network ties, the level of experience of problem solvers, and the level of difficulty of problems. The discussion focuses on the broad theoretical implications of the study for the relation between work practices and organizational structures. \^{a}º Organization of open productions emerges from individual problem solving attempts. \^{a}º Individual action is embedded in bipartite networks linking individuals to problems. \^{a}º Collaborative problem solving is enabled and sustained by network-based processes. \^{a}º Decentralized problem solving induces self-organizing configurations of network ties. \^{a}º Empirical evidence from a study of an open source software project is presented.}},

Estimates of structural parameters of Exponential Random Graph Models for two-mode networks reveal the structural logics shaping activities of collaborative problem solving. After controlling for contributor-specific and software bug-specific characteristics, we find that contributors ( ” problem solvers”) tend to distribute their activity over multiple software bugs. At the same time, however, we find that software bugs ( ” problems”) tend not to share multiple contributors. This dual tendency toward de-specialization and exclusivity is sustained by specific local network dependencies revealed by our analysis which also suggests possible organizational mechanisms that may be underlying the puzzling macro-structural regularities frequently observed, but rarely explained, in the production of open source software. By combining these mechanisms with the influence of contributors characterized by different levels of involvement in the project, we provide micro-level evidence of structural interdependence between  ” core” and  ” peripheral” members identified exclusively on the basis of their individual level of contribution to the project. \^{a}º We explore the structural logics of organizational problem-solving. \^{a}º We document emergent structural patterns of problem solvers and problems. \^{a}º In F/OSS hierarchical control and network dependencies induce organizational form.}},

Performance dropped significantly as group size was increased from one individual to two or to three, but the addition of a fourth, fifth, or sixth member produced insignificant additional decrements; thus, the effect was not linear but curvilinear. Study II was designed to examine possible sources of performance loss, separating the factors of \&ldquo;coordination\&rdquo; and \&ldquo;motivation\&rdquo; loss (Steiner, 1972). The possibility of intermember incoordination was eliminated, while motivation loss remained free to vary: Each experimental subject pulled alone, and in \&ldquo;groups\&rdquo; where he believed there were from one to five other members.

Although productivity was higher when subjects worked under personal rather than collective assessment instructions, type of session still had a major impact on brainstorming productivity under conditions that eliminated the temptation to free ride. Experiment 2 demonstrated that inducing evaluation apprehension reduced productivity in individual brainstorming. However, the failure to find an interaction between evaluation apprehension and type of session in Experiment 3 raises doubts about evaluation apprehension as a major explanation of the productivity loss in brainstorming groups. Finally, by manipulating blocking directly, we determined in Experiment 4 that production blocking accounted for most of the productivity loss of real brainstorming groups.

None of this research has examined those patterns of interactions in terms of the problem solving activities engaged. In this study, we compared the perceptions of participants, the nature of the comments made, and the patterns of communication in face-to-face and computer-mediated groups in terms of problem-solving activities while solving well-structured and ill-structured problems. The quantity of messages in the computer conference was smaller but more task related than in the face-to-face conversations because participants reflected more on ideas and perspectives in reaching their decisions. A cluster analysis of communication patterns showed that computer-mediated group decisions more closely resembled the general problem-solving process of problem definition, orientation, and solution development as group interaction progressed, while the face-to-face group interactions tended to follow a linear sequence of interactions. Participants who solved problems through computer conferencing were more satisfied with the process and believed that there was a greater quality in the problem-solving process.}},

Using the generalized NK-model of fitness landscapes, we differentiate modularity from decomposability. Modular and decomposable systems are both composed of subsystems, but in the former, these subsystems are connected via interface standards, while in the latter, subsystems are completely isolated. We derive the optimal level of modularity, which minimizes the time required to globally optimize a system, both for the case of two-layered systems and for the general case of multi-layered hierarchical systems containing modules within modules. This derivation supports the hypothesis of modularity as a mechanism to increase the speed of evolution. Our formal definition clarifies the concept of modularity and provides a framework and an analytical baseline for further research.}},

    abstract = {{Journalists, politicians, jurists, and legal academics often describe the privacy problem created by the collection and use of personal information through computer databases and the Internet with the metaphor of Big Brother - the totalitarian government portrayed in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.  Professor Solove argues that this is the wrong metaphor.  The Big Brother metaphor as well as much of the law that protects privacy emerges from a longstanding paradigm for conceptualizing privacy problems.  Under this paradigm, privacy is invaded by uncovering one's hidden world, by surveillance, and by the disclosure of concealed information.  The harm caused by such invasions consists of inhibition, self-censorship, embarrassment, and damage to one's reputation.  Privacy law has developed with this paradigm in mind, and consequently, it has failed to adapt to grapple effectively with the database problem.  Professor Solove argues that the Big Brother metaphor merely reinforces this paradigm and that the problem is better captured by Franz Kafka's The Trial.  Understood with the Kafka metaphor, the problem is the powerlessness, vulnerability, and dehumanization created by the assembly of dossiers of personal information where individuals lack any meaningful form of participation in the collection and use of their information.  Professor Solove illustrates that conceptualizing the problem with the Kafka metaphor has profound implications for the law of information privacy as well as which legal approaches are taken to solve the problem.}},

In this paper we present the first comprehensive analysis of the impact of a company\^{a}s privacy incidents on its market value. We compile a broad data set of instances of exposure of personal information due to failures of some security mechanism (hacking, stolen or lost equipment, poor data handling processes, and others) and we present the results of various empirical analyses, including event study analysis. We show that there exists a negative and statistically significant impact of data breaches on a company\^{a}s market value on the announcement day for the breach. The cumulative effect increases in magnitudes over the day following the breach announcement, but then decreases and loses statistical significance. We also present regression analyses that aim at disentangling the effects of a number of factors on abnormal stock returns due to reported breaches. Finally, we comment on the differences between the impact of the security breaches already described in the literature, and the privacy breaches described here.}},

We apply lessons from the research on behavioral economics to understand the individual decision making process with respect to privacy in electronic commerce. We show that it is unrealistic to expectindividual rationality in this context. Models of self-control problems and immediate gratification offer more realistic descriptions of the decision process and are more consistent with currently available data. In particular, we show why individuals who may genuinely want to protect their privacy might not do so because of psychological distortions well documented in the behavioral literature; we show that these distortions may affect not only 'naive' individuals but also 'sophisticated' ones; and we prove that this may occur also when individuals perceive the risks from not protecting their privacy as significant.}},

Although the laws are expected to reduce identity theft, their effect has yet to be empirically measured. We use panel data from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to estimate the impact of data breach disclosure laws on identity theft from 2002 to 2009.

Each agent plays a Prisoner\^{a}s Dilemma game with its local neighbors, collects an aggregate payoff, and imitates the strategy of its best neighbor. Agents may punish or reward their neighbors by removing or sustaining the interactions, according to their satisfaction level and strategy played. An agent may dismiss an interaction, and the corresponding neighbor is replaced by another randomly chosen agent, introducing diversity and evolution to the network structure. We perform an extensive numerical and analytical study, extending results in  M. G. Zimmermann, V. M. Egu\~{A}­luz and M. San Miguel  Phys. Rev.

The latter equilibrium solution is composed mostly by cooperative agents, with a minor population of defectors that exploit the cooperators. It is shown how the network adaptation dynamics favors the emergence of cooperators with the highest payoff. These \^{a}leaders\^{a} are shown to sustain the global cooperative steady state. Also we find that the average payoff of defectors is larger than the average payoff of cooperators.

We focus on the effect of reputation on an individual's partner-switching process. We assume that individuals can either change their strategies by imitating their partners or adjust their partnerships based on local information about reputations. We manipulate the partner switching in two ways; that is, individuals can switch from the lowest reputation partners, either to their partners' partners who have the highest reputation (i.e., ordering in partnership) or to others randomly chosen from the entire population (i.e., randomness in partnership). We show that when individuals are able to alter their behavioral strategies and their social interaction partnerships on the basis of reputation, cooperation can prevail. We find that the larger temptation to defect and the denser the partner network, the more frequently individuals need to shift their partnerships in order for cooperation to thrive. Furthermore, an increasing tendency of switching to partners' partners is more likely to lead to a higher level of cooperation. We show that when reputation is absent in such partner-switching processes, cooperation is much less favored than that of the reputation involved. Moreover, we investigate the effect of discounting an individual's reputation on the evolution of cooperation. Our results highlight the importance of the consideration of reputation (indirect reciprocity) on the promotion of cooperation when individuals can adjust their partnerships.}},

Players not only learn which strategy to adopt by imitating the strategy of the best-performing player they observe, but also choose with whom they should interact by selectively creating and/or severing ties with other players based on a myopic cost-benefit comparison. We find that scalable cooperation—that is, high levels of cooperation in large populations—can be achieved in sparse networks, assuming that individuals are able to sever ties unilaterally and that new ties can only be created with the mutual consent of both parties. Detailed examination shows that there is an important trade-off between local reinforcement and global expansion in achieving cooperation in dynamic networks. As a result, networks in which ties are costly and local structure is largely absent tend to generate higher levels of cooperation than those in which ties are made easily and friends of friends interact with high probability, where the latter result contrasts strongly with the usual intuition.}},

We find that the signs of links in the underlying social networks can be predicted with high accuracy, using models that generalize across this diverse range of sites. These models provide insight into some of the fundamental principles that drive the formation of signed links in networks, shedding light on theories of balance and status from social psychology; they also suggest social computing applications by which the attitude of one user toward another can be estimated from evidence provided by their relationships with other members of the surrounding social network.}},

The method involves viewing the estimation of such branching processes as analogous to incomplete data problems. Using an application from seismology, we show how the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model can, in fact, be estimated this way, and we propose a computationally efficient procedure to maximize the expected complete data log-likelihood function. Using a space?time ETAS model, we demonstrate that this method is extremely robust and accurate and use it to estimate declustered background seismicity rates of geologically distinct regions in Southern California. All regions show similar declustered background intensity estimates except for the one covering the southern section of the San Andreas fault system to the east of San Diego in which a substantially higher intensity is observed.}},

    abstract = {{Internet-based social networks often reflect extreme events in nature and society by drastic increases in user activity. We study and compare the dynamics of the two major complex processes necessary for information spread via the online encyclopedia 'Wikipedia', i.e., article editing (information upload) and article access (information viewing) based on article edit-event time series and (hourly) user access-rate time series for all articles. Daily and weekly activity patterns occur in addition to fluctuations and bursting activity. The bursts (i.e., significant increases in activity for an extended period of time) are characterized by a power-law distribution of durations of increases and decreases. For describing the recurrence and clustering of bursts we investigate the statistics of the return intervals between them. We find stretched exponential distributions of return intervals in access-rate time series, while edit-event time series yield simple exponential distributions. To characterize the fluctuation behavior we apply detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), finding that most article access-rate time series are characterized by strong long-term correlations with fluctuation exponents \^{I}±≈0.9\^{I}±≈0.9. The results indicate significant differences in the dynamics of information upload and access and help in understanding the complex process of collecting, processing, validating, and distributing information in self-organized social networks. \^{a}º We study the dynamics of information spread via Wikipedia articles. \^{a}º Fluctuations of access-rate time series scale with long-term persistence. \^{a}º Edit-events are only short-term correlated. \^{a}º The dynamics of both complex processes differ drastically.}},

    abstract = {{The interdependent nature of security on the Internet causes a negative externality that results in under-investment in technology-based defences. Previous research suggests that, in such an environment, cyber-insurance may serve as an important tool not only to manage risks but also to improve the incentives for investment in security. This paper investigates how competitive cyber-insurers affect network security and user welfare. We utilize a general setting, where the network is populated by identical users with arbitrary risk-aversion and network security is costly for the users. In our model, a user's probability to incur damage (from being attacked) depends on both his security and the network security.
                            First, we consider cyber-insurers who cannot observe (and thus, affect) individual user security. This asymmetric information causes moral hazard. If an equilibrium exists, network security is always worse relative to the no-insurance equilibrium. Though user utility may rise due to a coverage of risks, total costs to society go up due to higher network insecurity.
                            Second, we consider insurers with full information about their users' security. Here, user security is perfectly enforceable (zero cost). Each insurance contract stipulates the required user security and covers the entire user damage. Still, for a significant range of parameters, network security worsens relative to the no-insurance equilibrium. Thus, although cyber-insurance improves user welfare, in general, competitive cyber-insurers may fail to improve network security.}},

              be represented by asymptotic power law tails together with several
              cross-overs. These observations are
              explained by a simple stochastic branching process previously studied by
              many authors, the ETAS (epidemic-type aftershock sequence) model which
              assumes that each earthquake can trigger other earthquakes
              ( ” aftershocks”). An aftershock sequence results in this model from the
              cascade of aftershocks of each past earthquake. We develop the full
              theory in terms of generating functions for describing the space-time
              organization of earthquake sequences and develop several approximations
              to solve the equations. 
              The calibration of the theory to the empirical observations
              shows that it is essential to augment the ETAS model by taking account
              of the pre-existing frozen heterogeneity of spontaneous earthquake
              sources. This seems natural in view of the complex multi-scale nature of
              fault networks, on which earthquakes nucleate.
              Our extended theory is able to account for the empirical
              observation but some discrepancies, especially for the shorter time windows,
              point to limits of both our theoretical approach and of the ETAS model.}},

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known—a collaboration network and a food web—and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.}},

A key question is how to interpret the global organization of such networks as the coexistence of their structural subunits (communities) associated with more highly interconnected parts. Identifying these a priori unknown building blocks (such as functionally related proteins5, 6, industrial sectors7 and groups of people8, 9) is crucial to the understanding of the structural and functional properties of networks. The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes. Here we introduce an approach to analysing the main statistical features of the interwoven sets of overlapping communities that makes a step towards uncovering the modular structure of complex systems. After defining a set of new characteristic quantities for the statistics of communities, we apply an efficient technique for exploring overlapping communities on a large scale. We find that overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks. Our studies of collaboration, word-association and protein interaction graphs show that the web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties.}},

directed graphs, with types as nodes and dependencies as edges. The in-degree

the former resembling a power-law distribution and the latter an exponential
distribution. This effect appears to be independent of application or type
relationship. A simple generative model is proposed to explore the proposition
that the difference arises because the programmer is aware of the out-degree of
a type but not of its in-degree. The model reproduces the two distributions,
and compares reasonably well to those observed in 14 different type
relationships across 12 different Java applications.}},

    abstract = {{We present a comprehensive study of an implementation of the Smalltalk object oriented system, one of the first and purest object-oriented programming environment, searching for scaling laws in its properties. We study ten system properties, including the distributions of variable and method names, inheritance hierarchies, class and method sizes, system architecture graph. We systematically found Pareto - or sometimes log-normal - distributions in these properties. This denotes that the programming activity, even when modeled from a statistical perspective, can in no way be simply modeled as a random addition of independent increments with finite variance, but exhibits strong organic dependencies on what has been already developed. We compare our results with similar ones obtained for large Java systems, reported in the literature or computed by ourselves for those properties never studied before, showing that the behavior found is similar in all studied object oriented systems. We show how the Yule process is able to stochastically model the generation of several of the power-laws found, identifying the process parameters and comparing theoretical and empirical tail indexes. Lastly, we discuss how the distributions found are related to existing object-oriented metrics, like Chidamber and Kemerer's, and how they could provide a starting point for measuring the quality of a whole system, versus that of single classes. In fact, the usual evaluation of systems based on mean and standard deviation of metrics can be misleading. It is more interesting to measure differences in the shape and coefficients of the data?s statistical distributions.}},

@inproceedings{shibab2012,
    abstract = {{Modelling and understanding bugs has been the focus of much of the Software Engineering research today. However, organizations are interested in more than just bugs. In particular, they are more concerned about managing risk, i.e., the likelihood that a code or design change will cause a negative impact on their products and processes, regardless of whether or not it introduces a bug. In this paper, we conduct a year-long study involving more than 450 developers of a large enterprise, spanning more than 60 teams, to better understand risky changes, i.e., changes for which developers believe that additional attention is needed in the form of careful code or design reviewing and/or more testing. Our findings show that different developers and different teams have their own criteria for determining risky changes. Using factors extracted from the changes and the history of the files modified by the changes, we are able to accurately identify risky changes with a recall of more than 67\%, and a precision improvement of 87\% (using developer specific models) and 37\% (using team specific models), over a random model. We find that the number of lines and chunks of code added by the change, the bugginess of the files being changed, the number of bug reports linked to a change and the developer experience are the best indicators of change risk. In addition, we find that when a change has many related changes, the reliability of developers in marking risky changes is negatively affected. Our findings and models are being used today in practice to manage the risk of software projects.}},

@article{siggelkow2005,
    abstract = {{We use an innovative technique to examine an enduring but recently neglected question: How do environmental turbulence and complexity affect the appropriate formal design of organizations? We construct an agent-based simulation in which multidepartment firms with different designs face environments whose turbulence and complexity we control. The model's results produce two sets of testable hypotheses. One set pinpoints formal designs that cope well with three different environments: turbulent settings, in which firms must improve their performance speedily; complex environments, in which firms must search broadly; and settings with both turbulence and complexity, in which firms must balance speed and search. The results shed new light on longstanding notions such as equifinality. The other set of hypotheses argues that the impact of individual design elements on speed and search often depends delicately on specific powers granted to department heads, creating effects that run contrary to conventional wisdom and intuition. Ample processing power at the bottom of a firm, for instance, can slow down the improvement and narrow the search of the firm as a whole. Differences arise between our results and conventional wisdom when conventional thinking fails to account for the powers of department heads—powers to withhold information about departmental options, to control decision-making agendas, to veto firmwide alternatives, and to take unilateral action. Our results suggest how future empirical studies of organizational design might be fruitfully coupled with rigorous agent-based modeling efforts.}},

In this paper we use a large data-set obtained from SourceForge.net to estimate the relationship between a series of different characteristics of OS projects and the probability of evolution of the source code from a preliminary release to a mature version. We show that while projects distributed under highly restrictive licensing terms (GPL) have a significantly smaller probability of reaching a stable release, applications towards sophisticated users have a larger probability of evolving in the development status. Interestingly, we find that the size of the  ” community of developers” increases the chances of progress but this effect decreases as the community gets larger, a signal of possible coordination problems.}},

However, to date there has been no systematic investigation of code reuse in open source software projects. This study uses quantitative and qualitative data gathered from a sample of six open source software projects to explore two sets of research questions derived from the literature on software reuse in firms and open source software development. We find that code reuse is extensive across the sample and that open source software developers, much like developers in firms, apply tools that lower their search costs for knowledge and code, assess the quality of software components, and have incentives to reuse code. Open source software developers reuse code because they want to integrate functionality quickly, because they want to write preferred code, because they operate under limited resources in terms of time and skills, and because they can mitigate development costs through code reuse.}},

In this paper, we describe findings that address this paradox based on observation, interviews and quantitative analyses of two open-source projects.

Two main explanations have been offered: firm selection (larger cities toughen competition, allowing only the most productive to survive) and agglomeration economies (larger cities promote interactions that increase productivity), possibly reinforced by localized natural advantage. To distinguish between them, we nest a generalized version of a tractable firm selection model and a standard model of agglomeration. Stronger selection in larger cities left-truncates the productivity distribution, whereas stronger agglomeration right-shifts and dilates the distribution. Using this prediction, French establishment-level data, and a new quantile approach, we show that firm selection cannot explain spatial productivity differences. This result holds across sectors, city size thresholds, establishment samples, and area definitions.}},

@article{maccormack2012,
    abstract = {{A variety of academic studies argue that a relationship exists between the structure of an organization and the design of the products that this organization produces. Specifically, products tend to  ” mirror” the architectures of the organizations in which they are developed. This dynamic occurs because the organization's governance structures, problem solving routines and communication patterns constrain the space in which it searches for new solutions. Such a relationship is important, given that product architecture has been shown to be an important predictor of product performance, product variety, process flexibility and even the path of industry evolution. We explore this relationship in the software industry. Our research takes advantage of a natural experiment, in that we observe products that fulfill the same function being developed by very different organizational forms. At one extreme are commercial software firms, in which the organizational participants are tightly-coupled, with respect to their goals, structure and behavior. At the other, are open source software communities, in which the participants are much more loosely-coupled by comparison. The mirroring hypothesis predicts that these different organizational forms will produce products with distinctly different architectures. Specifically, loosely-coupled organizations will develop more modular designs than tightly-coupled organizations. We test this hypothesis, using a sample of matched-pair products. We find strong evidence to support the mirroring hypothesis. In all of the pairs we examine, the product developed by the loosely-coupled organization is significantly more modular than the product from the tightly-coupled organization. We measure modularity by capturing the level of coupling between a product's components. The magnitude of the differences is substantial—up to a factor of six, in terms of the potential for a design change in one component to propagate to others. Our results have significant managerial implications, in highlighting the impact of organizational design decisions on the technical structure of the artifacts that these organizations subsequently develop. \^{a}º We explore the relationship between product designs and organizational designs. \^{a}º We compare open source software with software developed by commercial firms. \^{a}º We measure modularity by capturing the level of coupling between components. \^{a}º We find that loosely coupled organizations tend to develop more modular products. \^{a}º The differences in modularity are substantial—up to a factor of six in our sample.}},

    abstract = {{The mirroring hypothesis predicts that the organizational patterns of a development project (e.g. communication links, geographic collocation, team and firm co-membership) will correspond to the technical patterns of dependency in the system under development. Scholars in a range of disciplines have argued that mirroring is either necessary or a highly desirable feature of development projects, but evidence pertaining to the hypothesis is widely scattered across fields, research sites, and methodologies. In this paper, we formally define the mirroring hypothesis and review 102 empirical studies spanning three levels of organization: within a single firm, across firms, and in open community-based development projects. The hypothesis was supported in 69\% of the cases. Support for the hypothesis was strongest in the within-firm sample, less strong in the across-firm sample, and relatively weak in the open collaborative sample. Based on a detailed analysis of the cases in which the mirroring hypothesis was not supported, we introduce the concept of actionable transparency as a means of achieving coordination without mirroring. We present examples from practice and describe the more complex organizational patterns that emerge when actionable transparency allows designers to 'break the mirror.'}},

Apart from being dynamically driven, the user interactions via posts is indirect, suggesting the importance of the contents of the posted material.
              We present a systematic way to study Blog data by combined approaches of physics of complex networks and computer science methods of text analysis. We are mapping the Blog data onto a bipartite network where users and posts with comments are two natural partitions. With the machine learning methods we classify the texts of posts and comments for their emotional contents as positive or negative, or otherwise objective (neutral). Using the spectral methods of weighted bipartite graphs, we identify topological communities featuring the users clustered around certain popular posts, and underly the role of emotional contents in the emergence and evolution of these

This process is assumed to be leading the world into a wealthy society with a better life. However, the current trend of globalization is not unprecedented in human history, and has had some severe consequences in the past. By applying a quantitative analysis through a microscopic representation we show that globalization, besides being unfair (with respect to wealth distribution), is also unstable and potentially dangerous as one event may lead to a collapse of the system. It is proposed that the optimal solution in controlling the unwanted aspects and enhancing the advantageous ones lies in limiting competition to large subregions, rather than making it worldwide.}},

Such changes are apparent in antibiotic and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) resistance to drugs, plant and insect resistance to pesticides, rapid changes in invasive species, life-history change in commercial fisheries, and pest adaptation to biological engineering products. This accelerated evolution costs at least \$33 billion to \$50 billion a year in the United States. Slowing and controlling arms races in disease and pest management have been successful in diverse ecological and economic systems, illustrating how applied evolutionary principles can help reduce the impact of humankind on evolution.}},

I suggest that changes in intellectual property rules alter the payoffs to information production in systematic and predictable ways that differ as among different strategies. My conclusion is that an institutional environment highly protective of intellectual property rights will (a) have less beneficial impact, at an aggregate level, than one would predict without considering these effects, and (b) fosters commercialization, concentration, and homogenization of information production, and thus entails normative implications that may be more salient than its quantitative effects.}},

Different institutions combine the three forms/mechanisms in different proportions.

One approach is to grant access to a platform and thereby open up markets for complementary components around the platform. Another approach is to give up control over the platform itself. Using data on 21 handheld computing systems (1990–2004), I find that granting greater levels of access to independent hardware developer firms produces up to a fivefold acceleration in the rate of new handheld device development, depending on the precise degree of access and how this policy was implemented. Where operating system platform owners went further to give up control (beyond just granting access to their platforms) the incremental effect on new device development was still positive but an order of magnitude smaller. The evidence from the industry and theoretical arguments both suggest that distinct economic mechanisms were set in motion by these two approaches to opening.}},

    abstract = {{Despite tendencies toward convergence, differences between individuals and groups continue to exist in beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. An agent-based adaptive model reveals the effects of a mechanism of convergent social influence. The actors are placed at fixed sites. The basic premise is that the more similar an actor is to a neighbor, the more likely that that actor will adopt one of the neighbor's traits. Unlike previous models of social influence or cultural change that treat features one at a time, the proposed model takes into account the interaction between different features. The model illustrates how local convergence can generate global polarization. Simulations show that the number of stable homogeneous regions decreases with the number of features, increases with the number of alternative traits per feature, decreases with the range of interaction, and (most surprisingly) decreases when the geographic territory grows beyond a certain size.}},

@article{david2008,
    abstract = {{A systems analysis perspective is adopted to examine the critical properties of the Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) mode of innovation, as reflected on the SourceForge platform (SF.net). This approach re-scales March's (1991) framework and applies it to characterize the  ” innovation system” of a  ” distributed organization” of interacting agents in a virtual collaboration environment, rather than to innovation within a firm. March (1991) views the process of innovation at the organizational level as the coupling of sub-processes of exploration and exploitation. Correspondingly, the innovation system of the virtual collaboration environment represented by SF.net is an emergent property of two  ” coupled” processes: one involves the interactions among agents searching the locale for information and knowledge resources to use in designing novel software products (i.e., exploration), and the other involves the mobilization of individuals' capabilities for application in the software development projects that become established on the platform (i.e., exploitation). The micro-dynamics of this system are studied empirically by constructing transition probability matrices representing the movements of 222,835 SF.net users among seven different activity states, which range from  ” lurking” (not contributing or contributing to projects without becoming a member) to  ” laboring” (joining one or more projects as members), and to  ” launching” (founding one or more projects) within each successive 6-month interval. The estimated probabilities are found to form first-order Markov chains describing ergodic processes. This makes it possible the computation of the equilibrium distribution of agents among the states, thereby suppressing transient effects and revealing persisting patterns of project joining and project launching. The latter show the FLOSS innovation process on SF.net to be highly dissipative: a very large proportion of the registered  ” developers” fail to become even minimally active on the platform. There is nevertheless an active core of mobile project joiners, and a (still smaller) core of project founders who persist in creating new projects. The structure of these groups' interactions (as displayed within the 3-year period examined) is investigated in detail, and it is shown that it would be sufficient to sustain both the exploration and exploitation phases of the platform's global dynamics.}},

    abstract = {{Trust is an important feature for all users of the Internet who rely on the safety and security of network technologies and systems for their daily lives. Trust, or the lack of it, has also been identified by the European Commission's Digital Agenda as a major barrier to further development of the information society in Europe. One of the areas in which concerns have been raised is in relation to children's safety online. As a result, substantial efforts have been made by policymakers and by the industry to build greater trust and confidence in online digital safety. This paper examines what trust means in the context of children's use of the Internet. Should policy on trust enhancement, for instance, include children's own trust in the technologies or services they use or is it sufficient to seek to reinforce parental and adult confidence that children can be adequately protected? What is required to build that trust from either perspective? Does it need, or should it include a relationship of trust between parents and children? To tease out these questions further, the paper examines current European Union policy frameworks on digital safety, particularly industry responses to the call for a more trusted Internet environment for children, and argues that technical solutions to be effective need to carefully balance a number of competing objectives and to be sufficiently grounded in evidence of parental and child experience of the Internet.}},

As people and firms specialize in different activities, economic efficiency increases, suggesting that development is associated with an increase in the number of individual activities and with the complexity that emerges from the interactions between them. Here we develop a view of economic growth and development that gives a central role to the complexity of a country's economy by interpreting trade data as a bipartite network in which countries are connected to the products they export, and show that it is possible to quantify the complexity of a country's economy by characterizing the structure of this network. Furthermore, we show that the measures of complexity we derive are correlated with a country's level of income, and that deviations from this relationship are predictive of future growth. This suggests that countries tend to converge to the level of income dictated by the complexity of their productive structures, indicating that development efforts should focus on generating the conditions that would allow complexity to emerge to generate sustained growth and prosperity.}},

Public goods experiments4, which are used to study this type of problem, usually confirm that the collective benefit will not be produced. Because individuals and countries often participate in several social games simultaneously, the interaction of these games may provide a sophisticated way by which to maintain the public resource. Indirect reciprocity8, 'give and you shall receive', is built on reputation and can sustain a high level of cooperation, as shown by game theorists9, 10, 11. Here we show, through alternating rounds of public goods and indirect reciprocity games, that the need to maintain reputation for indirect reciprocity maintains contributions to the public good at an unexpectedly high level. But if rounds of indirect reciprocation are not expected, then contributions to the public good drop quickly to zero. Alternating the games leads to higher profits for all players. As reputation may be a currency that is valid in many social games, our approach could be used to test social dilemmas for their solubility.}},

In reality, however, social cooperation can also arise spontaneously, based on local interactions rather than centralized control. The self-organization of cooperative behavior is particularly puzzling for social dilemmas related to sharing natural resources or creating common goods. Such situations are often described by the prisoner's dilemma. Here, we report the sudden outbreak of predominant cooperation in a noisy world dominated by selfishness and defection, when individuals imitate superior strategies and show success-driven migration. In our model, individuals are unrelated, and do not inherit behavioral traits. They defect or cooperate selfishly when the opportunity arises, and they do not know how often they will interact or have interacted with someone else. Moreover, our individuals have no reputation mechanism to form friendship networks, nor do they have the option of voluntary interaction or costly punishment. Therefore, the outbreak of prevailing cooperation, when directed motion is integrated in a game-theoretical model, is remarkable, particularly when random strategy mutations and random relocations challenge the formation and survival of cooperative clusters. Our results suggest that mobility is significant for the evolution of social order, and essential for its stabilization and maintenance.}},

Reciprocal altruism fails to provide a solution if interactions are not repeated often enough or groups are too large. Punishment and reward can be very effective but require that defectors can be traced and identified. Here we present a simple but effective mechanism operating under full anonymity. Optional participation can foil exploiters and overcome the social dilemma. In voluntary public goods interactions, cooperators and defectors will coexist. We show that this result holds under very diverse assumptions on population structure and adaptation mechanisms, leading usually not to an equilibrium but to an unending cycle of adjustments (a Red Queen type of evolution). Thus, voluntary participation offers an escape hatch out of some social traps. Cooperation can subsist in sizable groups even if interactions are not repeated, defectors remain anonymous, players have no memory, and assortment is purely random.}},

These models suggest that natural selection is likely to favor behavioral strategies leading to reciprocal cooperation when pairs of individuals interact repeatedly in potentially cooperative situations. Using the repeated n -person prisoner's dilemma game, we consider whether reciprocal altruism is also likely to evolve when social interactions involve more individuals. We show that the conditions that allow the evolution of reciprocal cooperation become extremely restrictive as group size increases. }},

    abstract = {{The iterated Prisoner's Dilemma has become the paradigm for the evolution of cooperation among egoists. Since Axelrod's classic computer tournaments and Nowak and Sigmund's extensive simulations of evolution, we know that natural selection can favor cooperative strategies in the Prisoner's Dilemma. According to recent developments of theory the last champion strategy of "win--stay, lose--shift" ("Pavlov") is the winner only if the players act simultaneously. In the more natural situation of players alternating the roles of donor and recipient a strategy of "Generous Tit-for-Tat" wins computer simulations of short-term memory strategies. We show here by experiments with humans that cooperation dominated in both the simultaneous and the alternating Prisoner's Dilemma. Subjects were consistent in their strategies: 30\% adopted a Generous Tit-for-Tat-like strategy, whereas 70\% used a Pavlovian strategy in both the alternating and the simultaneous game. As predicted for unconditional strategies, Pavlovian players appeared to be more successful in the simultaneous game whereas Generous Tit-for-Tat-like players achieved higher payoffs in the alternating game. However, the Pavlovian players were smarter than predicted: they suffered less from defectors and exploited cooperators more readily. Humans appear to cooperate either with a Generous Tit-for-Tat-like strategy or with a strategy that appreciates Pavlov's advantages but minimizes its handicaps.}},

    abstract = {{The puzzle of the emergence of cooperation between unrelated individuals is shared across diverse fields of behavioural sciences and economics. In this article we combine the public goods game originating in economics with evolutionary approaches traditionally used in biology. Instead of pairwise encounters, we consider the more complex case of groups of three interacting individuals. We show that territoriality is capable of promoting cooperative behaviour, as in the case of the Prisoner's Dilemma. Moreover, by adding punishment opportunities, the readiness to cooperate is greatly enhanced and asocial strategies can be largely suppressed. Finally, as soon as players carry a reputation for being willing or unwilling to punish, highly cooperative and fair outcomes are achieved. This group–beneficial result is obtained, intriguingly, by making individuals more likely to exploit their co–players if they can get away with it. Thus, less–cooperative individuals make more-cooperative societies.}},

In particular, variations of the value of the public good leads to transitions between one-, two-, and three-strategy states which either are in the class of directed percolation or show interesting analogies to Ising-type models.

@article{santos2008,
    abstract = {{Humans often cooperate in public goods games1, 2, 3 and situations ranging from family issues to global warming4, 5. However, evolutionary game theory predicts4, 6 that the temptation to forgo the public good mostly wins over collective cooperative action, and this is often also seen in economic experiments7. Here we show how social diversity provides an escape from this apparent paradox. Up to now, individuals have been treated as equivalent in all respects4, 8, in sharp contrast with real-life situations, where diversity is ubiquitous. We introduce social diversity by means of heterogeneous graphs and show that cooperation is promoted by the diversity associated with the number and size of the public goods game in which each individual participates and with the individual contribution to each such game. When social ties follow a scale-free distribution9, cooperation is enhanced whenever all individuals are expected to contribute a fixed amount irrespective of the plethora of public goods games in which they engage. Our results may help to explain the emergence of cooperation in the absence of mechanisms based on individual reputation and punishment10, 11, 12. Combining social diversity with reputation and punishment will provide instrumental clues on the self-organization of social communities and their economical implications.}},

    abstract = {{From biotechnology to cyber-risks, most extreme technological risks cannot be
reliably estimated from historical statistics. Therefore, engineers resort to
predictive methods, such as fault/event trees in the framework of probabilistic
safety assessment (PSA), which consists in developing models to identify
triggering events, potential accident scenarios, and estimate their severity
and frequency. However, even the best safety analysis struggles to account for
evolving risks resulting from inter-connected networks and cascade effects.
Taking nuclear risks as an example, the predicted plant-specific distribution
of losses is found to be significantly underestimated when compared with
available empirical records. Using a novel database of 99 events with losses
larger than \$50'000 constructed by Sovacool, we document a robust power law
distribution with tail exponent mu \approx 0.7. A simple cascade model suggests
that the classification of the different possible safety regimes is
intrinsically unstable in the presence of cascades. Additional continuous
development and validation, making the best use of the experienced realized
incidents, near misses and accidents, is urgently needed to address the
existing known limitations of PSA when aiming at the estimation of total risks.}},

This paper analyzes idea markets, which use widely distributed knowledge, the power of markets, and the Internet to support the crucial initial tasks of the new product development process, including the sourcing, filtering, and evaluation of new product ideas. Idea markets employ virtual stocks to represent new product ideas and allow participants to suggest and trade new product ideas in a virtual marketplace. This paper empirically explores the performance of idea markets in a real-world field study at a large, high-tech business-to-business company that includes more than 500 participants from 17 countries and features various idea sourcing tasks. The results indicate that idea markets are a feasible and promising method to support the fuzzy front end of the new product development process. Idea markets offer a platform and formal process to capture, select, and distribute ideas in an organization, which motivates employees to communicate their ideas to management. By effectively sourcing and contemporaneously filtering, idea markets help reduce the number of ideas brought to management's attention to those that seem worthy of further consideration. Because idea markets also have the ability to source many ideas, they can increase efficiency at the fuzzy front end of the new product development process.}},

                Humanity has just crossed a major landmark in its history with the majority of people now living in cities. Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease. The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from patent production and personal income to electrical cable length are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling exponents, beta, that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities reflecting wealth creation and innovation have beta approximately 1.2 >1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure display beta approximately 0.8 <1 (economies of scale). We predict that the pace of social life in the city increases with population size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which beta<1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse.

@article{luttmer2011,
    abstract = {{The Pareto-like tail of the size distribution of firms can arise from random growth of productivity or stochastic accumulation of capital. If the shocks that give rise to firm growth are perfectly correlated within a firm, then the growth rates of small and large firms are equally volatile, contrary to what is found in the data. If firm growth is the result of many independent shocks within a firm, it can take hundreds of years for a few large firms to emerge. This paper describes an economy with both types of shocks that can account for the thick-tailed firm size distribution, high entry and exit rates, and the relatively young age of large firms. The economy is one in which aggregate growth is driven by the creation of new products by both new and incumbent firms. Some new firms have better ideas than others and choose to implement those ideas at a more rapid pace. Eventually, such firms slow down when the quality of their ideas reverts to the mean. As in the data, average growth rates in a cross section of firms will appear to be independent of firm size, for all but the smallest firms.}},

@article{bonaccorsi2003a,
    abstract = {{Contrary to what most people assume, Open Source doesn't just mean access to the source code. A software is considered Open Source if and only if its distribution terms [i.e. the license] comply with the set of criteria defined by the Open Source Definition (OSD). That is, to say that a code is Open Source is to say that it is subject to a member of a particular category of licenses (McGowan, 2000).  As many others in the Open Source field, the research on Open Source licenses suffers from lack of empirical data. Although in the literature there are empirical studies that explore the relationships between license choice and project characteristics (Lerner and Tirole, 2002a), at present we are not aware of surveys that collect data on licensors, that is on firms producing and distributing software on an Open Source basis. This study addresses his shortcoming. We examine the license choice of the firms that supply Open Source products and services and relate it to their structural characteristics, business models and attitudes towards the movement and its community.  Between September 2002 and March 2003 we conducted a survey on Italian firms that do business with Open Source software. We asked them to indicate the Open Source licenses with which they work, for the distribution of their software as well as the production process. We made reference to the distinction between copyleft and non-copyleft distribution schemes. Using these data, this paper aims at testing several theoretical hypotheses advanced by the literature on Open Source licenses. In order to make the discussion more lively, for each issue we present the hypothesis and our findings in sequence.}},

@article{gal2012,
    abstract = {{The creation of free and open source software (FOSS) through social networks has been celebrated as one of the most interesting and inspiring developments of the information age. The main legal platform selected for facilitating this collaborative creation is the GNU General Public License (GPL). Software released under the GPL enables anyone to use, modify, and distribute the code. Yet, these rights are contingent upon virality: every copy or work based on the original code must also be subject to such terms and conditions. This article analyzes the interesting and intricate effects of virality on welfare and innovation. Virality increases motivations for parallel innovation, both in open source and in commercial code, inter alia by facilitating competition among networks and by preventing commercial firms from appropriating FOSS. At the same time, by almost closing the door on synergies between FOSS and commercial technologies, it limits cumulative innovation based on synergy and interoperability. As shown, FOSS creates an even stronger anti-commons tragedy than the patent regime. Virality's (non)regulation will thus determine the balance, as well as the connecting bridges, adopted by society between the two modes of production as well as between competition and synergy. While this issue arises in other contexts, the unique features of the software industry and of FOSS raise complex challenges. This article then analyzes market and legal responses to the GPL's virality. Such analysis is timely given that the viral GPL has become standard in many socially produced FOSS projects.}},

Based on a simple model of supply networks, we offer an interpretation of instabilities and oscillations observed in biological, ecological, economic, and engineering systems. We find that most supply networks display damped oscillations, even when their units—and linear chains of these units—behave in a nonoscillatory way. Moreover, networks of damped oscillators tend to produce growing oscillations. This surprising behavior offers, for example, a different interpretation of business cycles and of oscillating or pulsating processes. The network structure of material flows itself turns out to be a source of instability, and cyclical variations are an inherent feature of decentralized adjustments.}},

Most explanations start with Gibrat's rule of proportional growth but need to incorporate additional constraints and ingredients introducing deviations from it. We show that combining Gibrat's rule at all firm levels with random processes of firms' births and deaths yield Zipf's law under a "balance" condition between firm growth and their death rate. We predict deviations from Zipf's law under a variety of circumstances, which provides a framework for identifying the possible origin(s) of the many reports of  deviations from the pure Zipf's law. Reciprocally, deviations from Zipf's law in a given economy provides a diagnostic, suggesting possible policy corrections.}},

While the suppliers may expect these problems to occur, the users may be in a better position to both identify the exact nature of these problems and to solve them through their own innovations. In a detailed field-based study of the residential construction industry, I find that user-builders, rather than component manufacturers, are the developers of almost all of the innovations (n = 34) researched in depth. Using their expertise, the users quickly created low-cost, unique solutions to problems that appeared on-site, which were equivalent in cost and value to later manufacturer products. User-builders were also the exclusive source of innovations that concerned the integration of components. Manufacturers commercialized few user innovations, and excluded those that involved the connection of components. The prevalence of the user innovations and the lack of manufacturer commercialization indicates a de facto design partnership between users and manufacturers. The complementarity of learning-by-doing and user innovation during implementation has implications for the planning and management of the technology development process.}},

In this paper, we explore the incentives that users might have to freely reveal their proprietary innovations. We then develop a game-theoretic model to explore the effect of these incentives on users' decisions to reveal or hide their proprietary information.

    abstract = {{This paper provides a quantitative study (N = 268) of patterns of free revealing of firm-developed innovations within embedded Linux, a type of open source software (OSS). I find that firms, without being obliged to do so, contribute many of their own developments back to public embedded Linux code, eliciting and indeed receiving informal development support from other firms. That is, they perform a part of their product development open to the public—an unthinkable idea for traditionally minded managers. Such openness obviously entails the challenge of protecting one's intellectual property. I find that firms address this issue by revealing selectively. They reveal, on average, about half of the code they have developed, while protecting the other half by various means. Revealing is strongly heterogeneous among firms. Multivariate analysis can partly explain this heterogeneity by firm characteristics and the firm's purpose behind revealing. An analysis of reasons for revealing and of the type of revealed code shows that different types of firms have different rationales for openness. Implications for management are that the conflict between downsides and benefits of openness appears manageable. Provided selective revealing is practiced deliberately, the opportunities of open development dominate.}},

As the most interesting results, our multivariate analyses of developers\^{a} code reuse behavior point out that developers with larger personal networks within the OSS community and those who have experience in a greater number of OSS projects reuse more, presumably because both network size and a broad project experience facilitate local search for reusable artifacts. Moreover, we find that a development paradigm that calls for releasing an initial functioning version of the software early\^{a}as the \^{a}credible promise\^{a} in OSS\^{a}leads to increased reuse.

    abstract = {{Based on the analysis of the dependency network in 18 Java projects, we develop a novel model of network growth which considers both preferential attachment and the addition of new nodes with a heterogeneous distribution of their initial degree,  k 0 . Empirically we find that the cumulative distributions of initial and final degrees in the network follow power law behaviours: 1− P ( k 0 )∝ k 0 1−α , and 1− P ( k )∝ k 1−γ , respectively. For the total number of links as a function of the network size, we find empirically  K ( N )∝ N β , where β [1.25, 2] (for small  N ), while converging to β\~{}1 for large  N . This indicates a transition from a growth regime with increasing network density towards a sustainable regime, which prevents a collapse due to ever increasing dependencies. Our theoretical framework allows us to predict relations between the exponents α, β, γ, which also link issues of software engineering and developer activity. These relations are verified by means of computer simulations and empirical investigations. They indicate that the growth of real Open Source Software networks occurs on the edge between two regimes, which are dominated either by the initial degree distribution of added nodes, or by the preferential attachment mechanism. Hence, the heterogeneous degree distribution of newly added nodes, found empirically, is essential to describe the laws of sustainable growth in networks.}},

We present a strategy that is optimal for arbitrary trees, achieving maximum probability of correct localization. We describe efficient implementations with complexity O(Nα), where α=1 for arbitrary trees and α=3 for arbitrary graphs.

In order to describe also the space distribution of seismicity, we use in addition a power-law distribution \^{a}¼1/r1+\^{I}¼ of distances between triggered and triggering earthquakes. The ETAS model has been studied for the last two decades to model real seismicity catalogs and to obtain short-term probabilistic forecasts. Here, we present a mapping between the ETAS model and a class of CTRW (continuous time random walk) models, based on the identification of their corresponding master equations. This mapping allows us to use the wealth of results previously obtained on anomalous diffusion of CTRW. After translating into the relevant variable for the ETAS model, we provide a classification of the different regimes of diffusion of seismic activity triggered by a mainshock. Specifically, we derive the relation between the average distance between aftershocks and the mainshock as a function of the time from the mainshock and of the joint probability distribution of the times and locations of the aftershocks. The different regimes are fully characterized by the two exponents \^{I}¸ and \^{I}¼. Our predictions are checked by careful numerical simulations. We stress the distinction between the \^{a}bare\^{a} Omori law describing the seismic rate activated directly by a mainshock and the \^{a}renormalized\^{a} Omori law taking into account all possible cascades from mainshocks to aftershocks of aftershock of aftershock, and so on. In particular, we predict that seismic diffusion or subdiffusion occurs and should be observable only when the observed Omori exponent is less than 1, because this signals the operation of the renormalization of the bare Omori law, also at the origin of seismic diffusion in the ETAS model. We present predictions and insights provided by the ETAS to CTRW mapping which suggest different ways for studying seismic catalogs. Finally, we discuss the present evidence for our predicted subdiffusion of seismicity triggered by a main shock, stressing the caveats and limitations of previous empirical works.}},

    abstract = {{Do firms have adequate incentives to invest in protection against a risk whose magnitude depends on the actions of others? This paper characterizes the Nash equilibria for this type of interaction between agents, which we call the interdependent security (IDS) problem. When agents are identical, there are two Nash equilibria for a wide range of cost and risk parameters—either everyone invests in protection or no one does. In some situations the incentive to invest in protection approaches zero as the number of unprotected agents increases. We develop an IDS model by first focusing on airline security and comparing the structure of this problem with other IDS examples such as computer security, fire protection, vaccinations, protection against bankruptcy, and theft protection. The paper also examines the roles of insurance, liability, fines and subsidies, third party inspections, regulations and coordinating mechanisms for internalizing the negative externalities characteristic of these problems. The concluding section suggests directions for future theoretical and empirical research.}},

While a good understanding of the onset of chaos has been achieved, using as a mathematical tool the geometric theory of differentiable dynamical systems, moderately excited chaotic systems require new tools, which are provided by the ergodic theory of dynamical systems. This theory has reached a stage where fruitful contact and exchange with physical experiments has become widespread. The present review is an account of the main mathematical ideas and their concrete implementation in analyzing experiments. The main subjects are the theory of dimensions (number of excited degrees of freedom), entropy (production of information), and characteristic exponents (describing sensitivity to initial conditions). The relations between these quantities, as well as their experimental determination, are discussed. The systematic investigation of these quantities provides us for the first time with a reasonable understanding of dynamical systems, excited well beyond the quasiperiodic regimes. This is another step towards understanding highly turbulent fluids.}},

are notoriously difficult to predict, and sometimes even harder to rationalize. We argue that users
often underestimate the strong mutual dependence between their security strategies and the economic
environment (e.g., threat model) in which these choices are made and evaluated. This misunderstanding
weakens the effectiveness of users' security investments.
We study how economic agents invest into security in five different economic environments, that
are characteristic of different threat models. We consider generalized models of traditional public
goods games (e.g., total effort and weakest link) and two recently proposed games (e.g., weakest target
game). Agents may split their contributions between a public good (protection) and a private good (selfinsurance).
We can examine how incentives may shift between investment in a public good (protection)
and a private good (insurance), subject to factors such as network size, type of attack, loss probability,
loss magnitude, and cost of technology. We compare Nash equilibrium predictions for homogeneous and heterogeneous user populations. We also provide results for the social optima for different classes of attacks and defenses in the case of homogeneous agents.}},

Using three case studies on network formation, computer security, and TCP congestion control, we outline the limits of game-theoretic models relying on Nash equilibria, and we argue that considering competitive equilibria of a more general form helps in assessing the accuracy of a game theoretic model, and can even help in reconciling predictions from game-theoretic models with empirically observed behavior.}},

The overall effectiveness of these mechanisms is questionable. The foundation of environmental economics supports building a market as a solution to the problem of widespread vulnerabilities. In this work we propose a market for vulnerability credits.   This paper is a first step to developing a pricing scheme for vulnerabilities to increase infrastructure security. We begin by arguing that security is an externality and one which could be priced. We examine security taxonomies in terms of their usefulness for pricing security vulnerabilities. We discuss the parallel with pricing pollution. We address the issue of jump-starting the market. Regulatory mechanisms for collection are not extensively addressed, although pricing without payment is meaningless, the problem must be parsed to be solvable.}},

Late disclosure reduces the time window that customers are exposed to attacks, but decreases vendor's willingness to deliver quick patch. Currently, there is little or no guidance with each organization following it own ad-hoc policy. This paper is to demonstrate how through optimal timing of disclosure policy (time given to vendor to patch the vulnerability), policy makers can influence behavior of vendors and reduce social cost. We formulate a game-theoretic model. We show that vendors always choose to patch later than a socially optimal disclosure time. Social planner can optimally shrink the time window of disclosure to push vendors to deliver patch in a timely manner. We show that, in general, neither instant disclosure nor non-disclosure is optimal. We then extend the model to allow uncertainty in developing patch and show that increasing uncertainty incurs more cost and vendor delivers quicker patch. In response to larger uncertainty, social planner should shrink the time window. We further extend the model so that the proportion of users implementing patches depends on both the time elapsed and the quality of the patch as well. The corresponding optimal policy is more flexible-vendors have more time to develop a higher-quality patch. Our paper provides a decision tool in understanding how disclosure timing may affect vendor's decision and in turn, what should a policy maker do. 1.}},

In particular, there have been arguments made both in opposition to and in favor of alternatives such as full and instant disclosure and limited or no disclosure. An important consideration in this debate is the behavior of the software vendor. Does vulnerability disclosure policy have an effect on patch release behavior of software vendors? This paper compiles a unique data set from CERT/CC and Security Focus databases to answer this question. Our results suggest that early disclosure has significant positive impact on the vendor patching speed. Open source vendors patch more quickly than closed source vendors and severe vulnerabilities are patched faster. We also find that vendors respond slower to vulnerabilities not disclosed by CERT/CC. This might reflect unmeasured differences in the severity and importance of vulnerabilities. It might also reflect the stronger lines of communication between CERT/CC and vendors, and the value of the vulnerability analysis by CERT/CC. We also find that vendors are more responsible after the 9/11 event.}},

We measure the rate at which new code has been introduced and the rate at which vulnerabilities have been reported over the last 7.5 years and fifteen versions. We learn that 61\% of the lines of code in today's OpenBSD are foundational: they were introduced prior to the release of the initial version we studied and have not been altered since. We also learn that 62\% of reported vulnerabilities were present when the study began and can also be considered to be foundational. We find strong statistical evidence of a decrease in the rate at which foundational vulnerabilities are being reported. However, this decrease is anything but brisk: foundational vulnerabilities have a median lifetime of at least 2.6 years. Finally, we examined the density of vulnerabilities in the code that was altered/introduced in each version. The densities ranged from 0 to 0.033 vulnerabilities reported per thousand lines of code. These densities will increase as more vulnerabilities are reported.}},

The goodness-of-fit of the models, as measured by AIC values, is discussed for two high quality data sets, in different tectonic regions. AIC also allows the details of the clustering structure in space to be clarified. A simulation algorithm for the models is provided, and used to confirm the numerical accuracy of the likelihood calculations.

    abstract = {{Many time series in natural and social sciences can be seen as resulting from an interplay between exogenous influences and an endogenous organization. We use a simple epidemic-type aftershock model of events occurring sequentially, in which future events are influenced (partially triggered) by past events to ask the question of how well can one disentangle the exogenous events from the endogenous ones. We apply both model-dependent and model-independent stochastic declustering methods to reconstruct the tree of ancestry and estimate key parameters. In contrast with previously reported positive results, we have to conclude that declustered catalogs are rather unreliable for the synthetic catalogs that we have investigated, which contains of the order of thousands of events, typical of realistic applications. The estimated rates of exogenous events suffer from large errors. The branching ratio n, quantifying the fraction of events that have been triggered by previous events, is also badly estimated in general from declustered catalogs. We find, however, that the errors tend to be smaller and perhaps acceptable in some cases for small triggering efficiency and branching ratios. The high level of randomness together with the long memory makes the stochastic reconstruction of trees of ancestry and the estimation of the key parameters perhaps intrinsically unreliable for long-memory processes. For shorter memories (larger  ” bare” Omori exponent), the results improve significantly.}},

Here we show that this causal structure can be found probabilistically, with no a priori model nor parameterization. Large regional earthquakes are found to have a short direct influence in comparison to the overall aftershock sequence duration.

\_Volume I\_ contains the introductory chapters from the first edition together
with an account of basic models, second order theory, and an informal account

primarily interested in models and applications. It also has three appendices
that review the mathematical background needed mainly in Volume II.

\_Volume II\_ sets out the basic theory of random measures and point processes
in a unified setting and continues with the more theoretical topics of the
first edition: limit theorems, ergodic theory, Palm theory, and evolutionary
behaviour via martingales and conditional intensity. The very substantial new
material in this second volume includes expanded discussions of marked point
processes, convergence to equilibrium, and the structure of spatial point
processes.}},

@misc{schulte2012,
    abstract = {{In the mutation testing paradigm, test suite quality is measured by its
ability to detect variant programs generated through application of random
changes to an original program. In evolutionary biology however, neutral
mutations that leave fitness unchanged are considered to be
beneficial---improving the system's robustness and ability to discover
evolutionary improvements. In this paper, we generate a population of variant
programs from an original program by applying lightweight random mutations. We
adopt biological terminology and refer to undetected variants as neutral, and
the percentage of all variants that are neutral as mutational robustness.
Although they are related to equivalent mutants in mutation testing, which are
viewed as problematic, we show positive properties of neutral variants which
are easily generated and can be used to protect software against unknown
defects.


Even when mutations are restricted to statements executed by the test suit,
we find that mutational robustness is high: 36.75\% on a corpus of 22 programs
including production software projects, the Siemens benchmark, and a few
specially constructed programs. The results hold for mutations at the source
code and assembly instruction levels, across various programming languages, and
are not fully explained by test suite quality. We conclude that mutational
robustness is an inherent property of software, existing even when a program is
correct according to its specification. Rather than an indicator of test suite
inadequacy, it is an opportunity to create useful proactive diversity. To
demonstrate this, we generate and select diverse populations of neutral program
variants. For a program with seven or more held-out latent bugs, we can, on
average, construct and select seven neutral variants such that at least one
fixes a latent bug.}},

Rather than introducing new services, ISPs are presently moving towards greater commoditization. It is apparent that the network's primitive system of contracts does not align incentives properly. In this study, we identify the network's lack of accountability as a fundamental obstacle to correcting this problem: Employing an economic model, we argue that optimal routes and innovation are impossible unless new monitoring capability is introduced and incorporated with the contracting system. Furthermore, we derive the minimum requirements a monitoring system must meet to support first-best routing and innovation characteristics. Our work does not constitute a new protocol; rather, we provide practical and specific guidance for the design of monitoring systems, as well as a theoretical framework to explore the factors that influence innovation.}},

Many papers focused on vulnerability discovery models based upon either a public vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD), or vendor ones (e.g., MFSA). Some combine these databases. Most of these works address a knowledge problem: can we understand the empirical causes of vulnerabilities? Can we predict them? Still, if the data sources do not completely capture the phenomenon we are interested in predicting, then our predictor might be optimal with respect to the data we have but unsatisfactory in practice. In our work, we focus on a more fundamental question: the quality of vulnerability database. We provide an analytical comparison of different security metric papers and the relative data sources. We also show, based on experimental data for Mozilla Firefox, how using different data sources might lead to completely different results.}},

The resulting ranking of the most vulnerable components is a perfect base for further investigations on what makes components vulnerable. In an investigation of the Mozilla vulnerability history, we surprisingly found that components that had a single vulnerability in the past were generally not likely to have further vulnerabilities. However, components that had similar imports or function calls were likely to be vulnerable. Based on this observation, we were able to extend Vulture by a simple predictor that correctly predicts about half of all vulnerable components, and about two thirds of all predictions are correct. This allows developers and project managers to focus their their efforts where it is needed most: "We should look at nsXPInstallManager because it is likely to contain yet unknown vulnerabilities.".}},

@article{ugander2012,
    abstract = {{The concept of contagion has steadily expanded from its original grounding in epidemic disease to describe a vast array of processes that spread across networks, notably social phenomena such as fads, political opinions, the adoption of new technologies, and financial decisions. Traditional models of social contagion have been based on physical analogies with biological contagion, in which the probability that an individual is affected by the contagion grows monotonically with the size of his or her  ” contact neighborhood”—the number of affected individuals with whom he or she is in contact. Whereas this contact neighborhood hypothesis has formed the underpinning of essentially all current models, it has been challenging to evaluate it due to the difficulty in obtaining detailed data on individual network neighborhoods during the course of a large-scale contagion process. Here we study this question by analyzing the growth of Facebook, a rare example of a social process with genuinely global adoption. We find that the probability of contagion is tightly controlled by the number of connected components in an individual's contact neighborhood, rather than by the actual size of the neighborhood. Surprisingly, once this  ” structural diversity” is controlled for, the size of the contact neighborhood is in fact generally a negative predictor of contagion. More broadly, our analysis shows how data at the size and resolution of the Facebook network make possible the identification of subtle structural signals that go undetected at smaller scales yet hold pivotal predictive roles for the outcomes of social processes.}},

Laeven Dept. of Econometrics and Operations Research PO Box 90153 5000 LE Tilburg, The Netherlands E-Mail: R.J.A.Laeven@uvt.nl Adverse shocks to stock markets propagate across the world, with a jump in one region of the world seemingly causing an increase in the likelihood of a different jump in another region of the world. To capture this effect mathematically, we introduce a model for asset return dynamics with a drift component, a volatility component and mutually exciting jumps known as Hawkes processes. In the model, a jump in one region of the world or one segment of the market increases the intensity of jumps occurring both in the same region (self-excitation) as well as in other regions (cross-excitation). The model generates the type of jump clustering that is observed empirically. Jump intensities then mean-revert until the next jump. We develop and implement an estimation procedure for this model. Our estimates provide evidence for self-excitation both in the US market as well as in other world markets. Furthermore, we find that US jumps tend to get reflected quickly in most other markets, while statistical evidence for the reverse transmission is much less pronounced. Implications of the model for measuring market stress, risk management and optimal portfolio choise are also investigated.}},

Similar clustering patterns are observed by seismologists, as earthquakes are well known to increase the risk of subsequent earthquakes, or aftershocks, near the location of an initial event. Space–time clustering is modeled in seismology by self-exciting point processes and the focus of this article is to show that these methods are well suited for criminological applications. We first review self-exciting point processes in the context of seismology. Next, using residential burglary data provided by the Los Angeles Police Department, we illustrate the implementation of self-exciting point process models in the context of urban crime. For this purpose we use a fully nonparametric estimation methodology to gain insight into the form of the space–time triggering function and temporal trends in the background rate of burglary.}},

This complementarity enables WOT to provide warnings about malicious sites while differentiating the good sites from the unknowns. This in turn helps steer users away from the numerous bad sites created daily.

    abstract = {{Computer users express a strong desire to prevent attacks and to reduce the losses from computer and information security breaches. However, security compromises are common and widespread and highly damaging. Next to attackers' increased sophistication, a root cause for the harm inflicted is that users often fail to optimally protect their resources or to recover gracefully from a security breach. We argue that users often underestimate the strong mutual dependence between their security strategies and the economic environment (e.g., threat model) in which these choices are made and evaluated. This misunderstanding weakens the effectiveness of users' security investments, and is compounded by heterogeneity within the user population, in some cases further reducing incentives for cooperation and coordination. We study how economic agents invest into security in five different economic environments, that are characteristic of different threat models. We consider generalized models of traditional public goods games (e.g., total effort and weakest link) and two recently proposed games (e.g., weakest target game). Agents may split their contributions between a public good (protection) and a private good (self-insurance). Our analysis centers on how agents respond to incentives when important parameters of the game (i.e., loss probability, loss magnitude, and cost of technology) are heterogeneous in the agent population. We also highlight key differences to the case of homogeneous decision makers. For example, security investments may become substantially more sensitive to the size of the network. We extend our results to discuss important modes of intervention.}},

By modeling security investment decision-making in established (e.g., weakest-link, best-shot) and novel games (e.g., weakest-target), and allowing expenditures in self-protection versus self-insurance technologies, we can examine how incentives may shift between investment in a public good (protection) and a private good (insurance), subject to factors such as network size, type of attack, loss probability, loss magnitude, and cost of technology. We can also characterize Nash equilibria and social optima for different classes of attacks and defenses. In the weakest-target game, an interesting result is that, for almost all parameter settings, more effort is exerted at Nash equilibrium than at the social optimum. We may attribute this to the "strategic uncertainty" of players seeking to self-protect at just slightly above the lowest protection level.}},

                The ultimate proof of our understanding of natural or technological systems is reflected in our ability to control them. Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.

    abstract = {{Social norms and institutions are mechanisms that facilitate coordination between individuals. A social innovation is a novel mechanism that increases the welfare of the individuals who adopt it compared with the status quo. We model the dynamics of social innovation as a coordination game played on a network. Individuals experiment with a novel strategy that would increase their payoffs provided that it is also adopted by their neighbors. The rate at which a social innovation spreads depends on three factors: the topology of the network and in particular the extent to which agents interact in small local clusters, the payoff gain of the innovation relative to the status quo, and the amount of noise in the best response process. The analysis shows that local clustering greatly enhances the speed with which social innovations spread. It also suggests that the welfare gains from innovation are more likely to occur in large jumps than in a series of small incremental improvements.}},

                Social groups can be remarkably smart and knowledgeable when their averaged judgements are compared with the judgements of individuals. Already Galton [Galton F (1907) Nature 75:7] found evidence that the median estimate of a group can be more accurate than estimates of experts. This wisdom of crowd effect was recently supported by examples from stock markets, political elections, and quiz shows [Surowiecki J (2004) The Wisdom of Crowds]. In contrast, we demonstrate by experimental evidence (N = 144) that even mild social influence can undermine the wisdom of crowd effect in simple estimation tasks. In the experiment, subjects could reconsider their response to factual questions after having received average or full information of the responses of other subjects. We compare subjects' convergence of estimates and improvements in accuracy over five consecutive estimation periods with a control condition, in which no information about others' responses was provided. Although groups are initially "wise," knowledge about estimates of others narrows the diversity of opinions to such an extent that it undermines the wisdom of crowd effect in three different ways. The "social influence effect" diminishes the diversity of the crowd without improvements of its collective error. The "range reduction effect" moves the position of the truth to peripheral regions of the range of estimates so that the crowd becomes less reliable in providing expertise for external observers. The "confidence effect" boosts individuals' confidence after convergence of their estimates despite lack of improved accuracy. Examples of the revealed mechanism range from misled elites to the recent global financial crisis.

                Recent decades have experienced the discovery of numerous complex materials. At the root of the complexity underlying many of these materials lies a large number of contending atomic- and largerscale configurations. In order to obtain a more detailed understanding of such systems, we need tools that enable the detection of pertinent structures on all spatial and temporal scales. Towards this end, we suggest a new method that applies to both static and dynamic systems which invokes ideas from network analysis and information theory. Our approach efficiently identifies basic unit cells, topological defects, and candidate natural structures. The method is particularly useful where a clear definition of order is lacking, and the identified features may constitute a natural point of departure for further analysis.

In aggregate, consumers' annual product development expenditures are more than 1.4 times larger than the annual consumer product R\&D expenditures of all firms in the United Kingdom combined. Consumers engage in many small projects that seem complementary to the innovation efforts of incumbent producers. Consumer innovators very seldom protect their innovations via intellectual property, and 17\% diffuse to others. These results imply that, at the country level, productivity studies yield inflated effect sizes for producer innovation in consumer goods.

In the physical sciences this paradigm was implemented systematically and confirmed repeatedly by successful confrontation with reality. In the social sciences however, the possibilities to stage experiments to validate it are limited. During the 90's a series of dramatic political and economic events have provided the opportunity to do so. We exploit the resulting empirical evidence to validate a simple agent based alternative to the classical logistic dynamics. The post-liberalization empirical data from Poland confirm the theoretical prediction that the dynamics is dominated by singular rare events which insure the resilience and adaptability of the system. We have shown that growth is led by few singular  ” growth centers" (Fig. 1), that initially developed at a tremendous rate (Fig. 3), followed by a diffusion process to the rest of the country and leading to a positive growth rate uniform across the counties. In addition to the interdisciplinary unifying potential of our generic formal approach, the present work reveals the strong causal ties between the  ” softer" social conditions and their  ” hard" economic consequences.}},

    abstract = {{Reusing code that is downloadable from the Internet - particularly open source software (OSS) code - in commercial software development is attractive for both firms and their software developers. However, to avoid serious economic and legal consequences for firms, the license obligations of the reused code have to be met. While this risk seems to be manageable in systematic reuse, colloquial evidence suggests that when reusing Internet code in ad-hoc fashion, individual professional software developers sometimes do not treat license obligations properly. Quantitatively investigating this issue, we explore the ad-hoc Internet code reuse of professional software developers with a particular focus on license issues by analyzing a unique global dataset of 869 professional software developers. We find that ad-hoc Internet code reuse has become prevalent in commercial software development. Despite this, when reusing Internet code in ad-hoc fashion, professional software developers appear not to fully account for license issues potentially resulting from their behavior. Moreover, our results point out that professional software developers receive little effective training and information on the topic of Internet code reuse from official channels. Furthermore, professional software developers are on average not fully aware of many common Internet code license obligations, and tend to overestimate their own knowledge. Most firms also do not provide close guardrails to their software developers regarding Internet code reuse through policies. Consequently, a considerable share of professional software developers has violated Internet code license obligations in the past. Based on our findings we discuss practical implications for firms developing software and suggest levers to reduce the economic and legal risks from license violations through professional software developers' ad-hoc reuse of Internet code.}},

    abstract = {{Since no one is willing to undertake costly research and development to create innovation, incentives in the form of patents were instituted to motivate R\&D. In software development, contrary to economic intuition, open source software has emerged as a viable alternative source of innovation. The patenting system has performed reasonably well in enhancing many other technologies. Since the mid?1990s patenting of software and business methods is increasingly accepted in the United States. The legitimacy of many of these new patents is subject to controversy and debate. In this paper we examine the trend, rate of litigation and disposition of US patents in the US Federal Courts. We find that litigation rates of software and business method patents is four times that of all other patents and is increasing. A majority of patent litigations are not won by the perpetrator of the lawsuits. The open source software community is not immune to heightened patent litigations. Since software development is incremental, the paths of OSS and commercial development are entwined. The spillover of patent litigation into OSS may have disastrous consequences: It may increase the ?cost? of OSS, dissuade volunteer developers and make OSS less attractive to users.}},

We exploit the observed pattern of contributions – the 'revealed preference' of developers - to infer the underlying incentives. Using detailed information on code contributions and project membership, we classify developers into distinct groups and study how contributions from each developer type vary by license (contract) type and other project characteristics. The central empirical finding is that developers strongly sort by license type, project size and corporate sponsorship. This evidence confirms the importance of heterogeneous motivations, specifically a key role for motivated agents and reputation, but less for reciprocity.}},

    abstract = {{This paper presents preliminary results from a pilot experiment dealing with the economic motivations to contribute to Free/Open Source Software (FOSS). In a seminal paper Bessen and Maskin (2006) argue that in a dynamic sequential innovation framework in which every innovation builds on previous inventions the standard argument for granting patent protection is no more valid and the innovator has at certain conditions an incentive to fully disclose the results of his works; in these same conditions, a copyright strategy could result in a tragedy of the anticommons (Heller 1998, Buchanan 2000). We study in the lab the choice of copyrighting or copylefting subsequent innovations in a dynamic setting \`{a} la Bessen and Maskin, introducing an innovative experimental design requiring real effort on the part of subjects. The players are asked to actually 'innovate' producing words from given letters, and face the choice to copyright or copyleft their words. Subsequent words can be created by modifying existing words, for free if a word is copylefted, and paying a fixed license fee if the word is copyrighted. Preliminary results show that copyleft is more likely to emerge when royalty fees are relatively high, and when the extendability, modularity and manipulability of inventions is enhanced. Moreover, copyleft innovations are sparsely started but once set in motion attract a higher number of contributors than copyrighted innovations, generating higher quality innovations and showing a more thorough exploration of possible profitable extensions. Finally, high royalty fees tend to generate anticommons effects, namely a lower rate of cooperation resulting in underuse of resources and lower innovative output.}},

    abstract = {{This paper deals with the allocation of effort across the different software projects that collectively make up the Open Source Software 'ecology'. Free/Libre Open Source Software projects share many features with pure public goods; nonetheless, projects often compete for 'success' inside the FOSS community at large. The central research question of this paper is then, how do developers choose where to direct their efforts amongst the thousands of existing software projects? How come developers choose to launch new projects when established alternatives are available? Why is the vast majority of Open Source projects a failure? The paper proposes a simple dynamic stochastic model that addresses these issues. Following methodological insight from Duffy (2006), we combine agent based simulations with human subjects lab experiments. As a benchmark, the model is simulated using a simple agent-based code assuming optimizing behaviour and risk neutrality at all times on the part of identical agents. The assumptions on optimal behaviour are then tested in the lab with human subjects, showing persistent and systematic biases in human behaviour: human players tend to be risk propense and to attach value to a label of 'project leadership'. These systematic biases are then built into a new round of simulations, showing a drastically better ﬁt with the real picture, as implied by data from the SourceForge.net dataset, and an enhancement of the evolutionary characteristics of the model (higher project quality in time). Results hints to the fact that in Open Source communities high risk propensity and excessive attachment to one's own project can be collectively beneﬁcial. FOSS communities appear able to harness the efforts of thousands of developers, turning their risk propension and overconﬁdence into a collective gain.}},

    abstract = {{Deployed software systems are typically composed of many pieces, not all of which may have been created by the main development team. Often, the provenance of included components -- such as external libraries or cloned source code -- is not clearly stated, and this uncertainty can introduce technical and ethical concerns that make it difficult for system owners and other stakeholders to manage their software assets. In this work, we motivate the need for the recovery of the provenance of software entities by a broad set of techniques that could include signature matching, source code fact extraction, software clone detection, call flow graph matching, string matching, historical analyses, and other techniques. We liken our provenance goals to that of Bertillonage, a simple and approximate forensic analysis technique based on bio-metrics that was developed in 19th century France before the advent of fingerprints. As an example, we have developed a fast, simple, and approximate technique called anchored signature matching for identifying library version information within a given Java application. This technique involves a type of structured signature matching performed against a database of candidates drawn from the Maven2 repository, a 150GB collection of open source Java libraries. An exploratory case study using a proprietary e-commerce Java application illustrates that the approach is both feasible and effective.}},

    abstract = {{The rise of cybercrime in the last decade is an economic case of individuals responding to monetary and psychological incentives. Two main drivers for cybercrime can be identified: the potential gains from cyberattacks are increasing with the growth of importance of the Internet, and malefactors' expected costs (e.g., the penalties and the likelihood of being apprehended and prosecuted) are frequently lower compared with traditional crimes. In short, computer-mediated crimes are more convenient, and protable, and less expensive and risky than crimes not mediated by the Internet. The increase in cybercriminal activities, coupled with ineffective legislation and ineffective law enforcement pose critical challenges for maintaining the trust and security of ourcomputer infrastructures.Modern computer attacks encompass a broad spectrum of economic activity, where various malfeasants specialize in developing specic goods (exploits, botnets, mailers) and services (distributing malware, monetizing stolen credentials, providing web hosting, etc.). A typical Internet fraud involves the actions of many of these individuals, such as malware writers, botnet herders, spammers, data brokers, and money launderers.Assessing the relationships among various malfeasants is an essential piece of information for discussing economic, technical, and legal proposals to address cybercrime. This paper presents a framework for understanding the interactions between these individuals and how they operate. We follow three steps.First, we present the general architecture of common computer attacks, and discuss the flow of goods and services that supports the underground economy. We discuss the general flow of resources between criminal groups and victims, and the interactions between different specialized cybercriminals.Second, we describe the need to estimate the social costs of cybercrime and the profits of cybercriminals in order to identify optimal levels of protection. One of the main problems in quantifying the precise impact of cybercrime is that computer attacks are not always detected, or reported. Therefore we propose the need to develop a more systematic and transparent way of reporting computer breaches and their effects.Finally, we propose some possible countermeasures against criminal activities. In particular, we analyze the role private and public protection, and the incentives of multiple stake holders.}},

Not only do MMORPGs appeal to a broad age range (Mage = 26.57, range = 11?68), but the appeal is strong (on average 22 hours of usage per week) across users of all ages (r = ?.04). An exploratory factor analysis revealed a five factor model of user motivations?Achievement, Relationship, Immersion, Escapism, and Manipulation?illustrating the multifaceted appeal of these online environments. Male players were significantly more likely to be driven by the Achievement and Manipulation factors, while female players were significantly more likely to be driven by the Relationship factor. Also, the data indicated that users derived meaningful relationships and salient emotional experiences, as well as real-life leadership skills from these virtual environments.

    abstract = {{In our innovation-driven world we tend to lay concepts that have lost their attractiveness to rest and rush to embrace the next giant leap. However, in most fields of creation, patterns of reawakening of old, extinct innovations can be found. It often looks as if new technological and social concepts have a life of their own, survival instincts and adaptive properties: They simply refuse to die. Should these phenomena be resolved on an ad hoc basis or are they grounded in the foundation of social behavior or evolutionary processes of technology? In conditions in which continuum equations would predict the extinction of a population, the presently offered microscopic representation proves that individuals self-organize in spatiotemporally localized adaptive patches that ensure their survival, resilience, and development as a collective. A similar treatment can explain why so many innovations are inevitably reborn. Accordingly, in assessing the value of social ideas, trends and even wants we ought to consider longer time frames following the decline of innovations, otherwise we might prematurely and erroneously discard successful promising concepts.}},

    abstract = {{Free and open source software (FOSS) is often distributed in binary packages, sometimes part of GNU/Linux operating system distributions, or part of products distributed/sold to users. FOSS creates great opportunities for users, developers and integrators, however it is important for them to understand the licensing requirements of any package they use. Determining the license of a package and assessing whether it depends on other software with incompatible licenses is not trivial. Although this task has been done in a labor intensive manner by software distributions, automatic tools to perform this analysis are highly desired. This paper proposes a method to understand licensing compatibility issues in software packages, and reports an empirical study aimed at auditing licensing issues in binary packages of the Fedora-12 GNU/Linux distribution. The objective of this study is (i) to understand how the license declared in packages is consistent with those of source code files, and (ii) to audit the licensing information of Fedora-12, highlighting cases of incompatibilities between dependent packages. The obtained results—supported by feedback received from Fedora contributors—show that there exist many nuances in determining the license of a binary package from its source code, as well as cases of license incompatibility issues due to package dependencies.}},

    abstract = {{In spite of suppression efforts, severe wildfires burn large areas of southern California grassland, coastal sage scrub, and chaparral. Such large burns may not have been characteristic prior to the initiation of fire suppression more than 70 years ago. To compare controlled with uncontrolled areas, wildfires of southern California and adjacent northern Baja California were evaluated for the period 1972 to 1980 from Landsat imagery. Fire size and location, vegetation, year, and season were recorded. It was found that suppression has divergent effects on different plant communities depending on successional processes, growth rates, fuel accumulation, decomposition rates, and length of flammability cycles. These variables establish feedback between the course of active fires, fire history, spatial configuration of flammable vegetation, and fire size. Suppression has minimal impact in coastal sage scrub and grassland. Fire control in chaparral reduces the number of fires, not burned hectarage; fires consequently increase in size, spread rate, and intensity and become uncontrollable in severe weather conditions. The Baja California chaparral fire regime may serve as a model for prescribed burning in southern California.}},

We find that although Bluetooth viruses can reach all susceptible handsets with time, they spread slowly because of human mobility, offering ample opportunities to deploy antiviral software. In contrast, viruses using multimedia messaging services could infect all users in hours, but currently a phase transition on the underlying call graph limits them to only a small fraction of the susceptible users. These results explain the lack of a major mobile virus breakout so far and predict that once a mobile operating system's market share reaches the phase transition point, viruses will pose a serious threat to mobile communications.}},

A review of the empirical literature reveals a variety of interpretations about some aspects of the phenomenon such as its underlying causal mechanisms and its level of analysis. To stimulate further progress in empirical research on dominant designs, we advocate a standardization of terminology by conceptualizing products as complex artifacts that evolve in the form of a nested hierarchy of technology cycles. Such a nested complex system perspective provides both unambiguous definitions of dominant designs (stable core components that can be stable interfaces) and inclusion of multiple levels of analysis (system, subsystems, components). We introduce the concept of an operational principle and offer a systematic definition of core and peripheral subsystems based on the concept of pleiotropy. We also discuss how the proposed terminological standardization can stimulate cumulative research on dominant designs.}},

While existing knowledge-based theory focuses on the efficiency of hierarchy in economizing on knowledge exchange, we develop a theory of the firm that focuses on the efficiency of alternative organizational forms in generating knowledge or capability. Our theory begins with the problem as the basic unit of analysis, arguing that a problem's complexity influences the optimal method of solution search and the optimal means of organizing that search. The distinguishing feature that differentiates among organizational alternatives is the different way each resolves conflict over the selection of solution trials, that is, the way it chooses the path of search. Our theory predicts that efficiency demands that these governance alternatives be matched in a discriminating way to problems based on their associated benefits and costs in governing solution search. Thus, our theory is among the first to simultaneously treat both the boundary choice (i.e., internal versus external) and the choice among alternative internal approaches to organizing.}},

The conclusions overall suggest that most of the studies reviewed were descriptive and conducted in higher education settings involving participants from North America, and that past wiki research had been most frequently conducted in the education, and engineering and sciences disciplines. The question on whether the use of wikis can improve learners' outcome such as writing ability is unresolved. Students liked the asynchronicity and traceability features of the wiki. Students' use of wikis seemed to be influenced by four main factors: wiki usability, pedagogical issues, social environment and students' technical knowledge and skills.

Early sections discuss the advantages of Wiki Web sites, which allow all users to add and edit content. While it might sound like a free-for-all, the authors suggest such Web sites have been used successfully in research, business, and education to document project designs, for brainstorming, and for otherwise creating content in a collaborative fashion. Case studies for such organizations as Georgia Tech, New York Times Digital, and Motorola give a glimpse of Wiki used in real settings, so you will get a sense of what to expect.<p>  This book is also a guide to the nuts and bolts of downloading and installing Wiki and customizing it for your site. Sections on basic tweaks to Wiki's Perl scripts will let you customize your site to match your organization's needs. Standout material includes almost three dozen customization tips. This volume is illustrated with actual screen shots of Wiki, so you can get a sense of what it is like for users to work together in such an unrestricted fashion. <p>  Throughout the text, the authors are suitably upbeat about Wiki's prospects for wider adoption, but they are realistic enough to note compromises (such as requiring passwords and restricting edit rights) required in business settings. They also survey the field of Wiki open-source projects and clones, as well as other similar content-management solutions (such as Zope and the emerging WebDAV standard).<p>  While it's hard to predict whether Wiki-based Web sites are for everyone, this book presents the pros and cons of a potentially exciting and useful tool that promotes collaborative content creation. This title can help any organization get going with a Wiki Web site, from the standpoint of planning, deployment, and basic administration. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B><ul><li>Collaboration tools explained <li>Web-based collaboration <li>WebDAV <li>Introduction to Wiki <li>User conventions with Wiki <li>Survey of Wiki open-source projects and clones <li>Installing Wiki (including Apache Web Server and security issues) <li>Using Wiki (making notes, Wiki used as a PIM, content management and links, page editing) <li>How to structure Wiki content (suggested default structure: pros and cons) <li>Customizing Wiki <li>Tour of Wiki Perl scripts and tips for customizing your Wiki site <li>Wiki add-ons (including spellchecking and uploading files) <li>Administration in Wiki (viewing events, controlling access and authentication, database administration, and debugging techniques) <li>Guidelines for Wiki projects (dos and don'ts) <li>Wiki case studies for education <li>Business and research</ul> }},

@techreport{slavin1982,
    abstract = {{This monograph presents descriptions of six extensively researched and widely used cooperative learning methods and discusses research on the effects of cooperative learning. The term "cooperative learning" refers to instructional methods in which students of all levels of performance work together in small groups toward a common goal. The essential feature of cooperative learning is that the success of one student helps other students to be successful. The six methods are: (1) Student Teams Achievement Divisions (STAD); (2) Teams-Games-Tournaments (TGT); (3) Team-Assisted Individualization (TAI); (4) Jigsaw; (5) Learning Together; and (6) Group Investigation. Some methods are highly structured, with well-specified group tasks and group rewards, while others give more autonomy to  students and have fewer specified group rewards. Some of these methods are used almost exclusively in social studies, and one is designed only for mathematics. Several can be used in all subject areas. All grade levels are represented. A case study of a junior high school student experiencing student team learning methods is presented, illustrating how team learning methods are used and where they are most effective. Reports are presented on research studies that examined the various methods of implementing student team cooperative learning. Their impact on academic achievement, intergroup relations, mainstreaming, and student self-esteem is discussed. The overall conclusion drawn from this research was that, when the classroom is structured so that students can work cooperatively on  learning tasks, students benefit academically as well as socially. A 58-item bibliography is appended. (JD)}},

This article examines current thinking about learning within the framework of cognitive psychology and how a new, cognitive conception of learning can guide future research on both learning and instruction. Similarities and differences between behavioral and cognitive conceptions of learning are discussed, along with issues such as the active (rather than passive) nature of learning, the concern for understanding (i.e., comprehension), the role of prior knowledge, the cumulative nature of most forms of human learning, and the role played by cognitive analyses of performance. Several cognitive theories of learning are presented as examples of how cognitive psychology has influenced research on learning.}},

    abstract = {{National commissions and scholarly reports on the status of contemporary higher education have frequently been critical of the college experience; the emphasis on transmitting fixed bodies of information and a failure to develop problem solving and critical thinking skills have been cited as serious weaknesses in higher education systems. Colleges and universities have additional reasons to redevelop central pedagogies for students. Individuals need to learn at higher rates of effectiveness and efficiency than ever before because of rapidly growing bodies of relevant information and the escalation of knowledge and skill requirements for most jobs.Recent developments incomputer hardware, software, and communication technologies create exciting new opportunities for the educational use of these technologies. The objective of this study is to go beyond the traditional classroom instructional modesl (e.g., lectures and class discussions) to develop and evaluate computer-supported pedagogical approaches. More specifically, this study investigates whether the use of a group decision support system (GDSS) in a collaborative learning process enhances student learning and evaluation of classroom experiences.The findings of a study involving 127 MBA students indicate that GDSS-supported collaborative learning leads to higher levels of perceived skill development, self-reported learning, and evaluation of classroom experience in comparison with non-GDSS supported collaborative learning. Furthermore, the final test grades of the group of students who were exposed to GDSS-supported collaborative learning were significantly higher than those of the other groups of students who participated in the experiment.}},

    abstract = {{We show how to use collaborative learning groups (CLGs) during scheduled class periods to facilitate students' learning. First we discuss faculty members' misgivings about CLGs. Some of these may be related to the human relations school, which led managers to believe that they could exploit workers' informal ties to increase productivity. Sociologists criticized the manipulative tendencies of this school, but critics may have turned the discipline away from the nonexploitative use of small groups and even from the study of group dynamics. As a result, most sociologists are unaware of research on how collaborative learning groups can improve students' academic performance, social skills, and ability to take the perspective of others. We present strategies and procedures for using CLGs in college classrooms. Specifically, we show 1) how to keep groups "on task," 2) how to eliminate "free riders," and 3) how to reduce the number of students who are either dominants or isolates in their groups. Next we examine test data, interaction preferences among classmates, and students' written evaluations of the group experience. We find that students do better on test material which was discussed in group sessions, that connections to classmates increase significantly, and that the great majority of students laud the use of CLGs. Because our results are provisional, we close with a problem-solving agenda that will help to answer unresolved questions about the use and effectiveness of collaborative learning.}},

Using corpus linguistic methods and factor analysis of word counts for features of formality and informality, we show that the greater the degree of post-production editorial control afforded by the system, the more formal and standardized the language of the collaboratively-authored documents becomes, analogous to that found in traditional print encyclopedias. Paradoxically, users who faithfully appropriate such systems create homogeneous entries, at odds with the goal of open-access authoring environments to create diverse content. The findings shed light on how users, acting through mechanisms provided by the system, can shape (or not) features of content in particular ways. We conclude by identifying sub-genres of web-based collaborative authoring environments based on their technical affordances.}},

We have begun a series of design studies to investigate links between wiki publishing experiences and writing-to-learn. The results of an initial study in an undergraduate government course indicate that perceived audience plays an important role in helping students monitor the quality of writing; however, students' perception of audience on the Internet is not straightforward.

                Corporate leaders seeking to boost growth, learning, and innovation may find the answer in a surprising place: the Linux open-source software community. Linux is developed by an essentially volunteer, self-organizing community of thousands of programmers. Most leaders would sell their grandmothers for workforces that collaborate as efficiently, frictionlessly, and creatively as the self-styled Linux hackers. But Linux is software, and software is hardly a model for mainstream business. The authors have, nonetheless, found surprising parallels between the anarchistic, caffeinated, hirsute world of Linux hackers and the disciplined, tea-sipping, clean-cut world of Toyota engineering. Specifically, Toyota and Linux operate by rules that blend the self-organizing advantages of markets with the low transaction costs of hierarchies. In place of markets' cash and contracts and hierarchies' authority are rules about how individuals and groups work together (with rigorous discipline); how they communicate (widely and with granularity); and how leaders guide them toward a common goal (through example). Those rules, augmented by simple communication technologies and a lack of legal barriers to sharing information, create rich common knowledge, the ability to organize teams modularly, extraordinary motivation, and high levels of trust, which radically lowers transaction costs. Low transaction costs, in turn, make it profitable for organizations to perform more and smaller transactions--and so increase the pace and flexibility typical of high-performance organizations. Once the system achieves critical mass, it feeds on itself. The larger the system, the more broadly shared the knowledge, language, and work style. The greater individuals' reputational capital, the louder the applause and the stronger the motivation. The success of Linux is evidence of the power of that virtuous circle. Toyota's success is evidence that it is also powerful in conventional companies.

    abstract = {{At present, the design of computer-supported group-based learning (CSGBL) is often based on subjective decisions regarding tasks, pedagogy and technology, or concepts such as 'cooperative learning' and 'collaborative learning'. Critical review reveals these concepts as insufficiently substantial to serve as a basis for CSGBL design. Furthermore, the relationship between outcome and group interaction is rarely specified a priori. Thus, there is a need for a more systematic approach to designing CSGBL that focuses on the elicitation of expected interaction processes. A framework for such a process-oriented methodology is proposed. Critical elements that affect interaction are identified: learning objectives, task-type, level of pre-structuring, group size and computer support. The proposed process-oriented method aims to stimulate designers to adopt a more systematic approach to CSGBL design according to the interaction expected, while paying attention to critical elements that affect interaction. This approach may bridge the gap between observed quality of interaction and learning outcomes and foster CSGBL design that focuses on the heart of the matter: interaction.}},

    abstract = {{Validation is often defined as the process of determining the degree to which a model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of its intended uses. Validation is crucial as industries and governments depend increasingly on predictions by computer models to justify their decisions. We propose to formulate the validation of a given model as an iterative construction process that mimics the often implicit process occurring in the minds of scientists. We offer a formal representation of the progressive build-up of trust in the model. Thus, we replace static claims on the impossibility of validating a given model by a dynamic process of constructive approximation. This approach is better adapted to the fuzzy, coarse-grained nature of validation. Our procedure factors in the degree of redundancy versus novelty of the experiments used for validation as well as the degree to which the model predicts the observations. We illustrate the methodology first with the maturation of quantum mechanics as the arguably best established physics theory and then with several concrete examples drawn from some of our primary scientific interests: a cellular automaton model for earthquakes, a multifractal random walk model for financial time series, an anomalous diffusion model for solar radiation transport in the cloudy atmosphere, and a computational fluid dynamics code for the Richtmyer–Meshkov instability.}},

                People exert large amounts of problem-solving effort playing computer games. Simple image- and text-recognition tasks have been successfully 'crowd-sourced' through games, but it is not clear if more complex scientific problems can be solved with human-directed computing. Protein structure prediction is one such problem: locating the biologically relevant native conformation of a protein is a formidable computational challenge given the very large size of the search space. Here we describe Foldit, a multiplayer online game that engages non-scientists in solving hard prediction problems. Foldit players interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and user-friendly versions of algorithms from the Rosetta structure prediction methodology, while they compete and collaborate to optimize the computed energy. We show that top-ranked Foldit players excel at solving challenging structure refinement problems in which substantial backbone rearrangements are necessary to achieve the burial of hydrophobic residues. Players working collaboratively develop a rich assortment of new strategies and algorithms; unlike computational approaches, they explore not only the conformational space but also the space of possible search strategies. The integration of human visual problem-solving and strategy development capabilities with traditional computational algorithms through interactive multiplayer games is a powerful new approach to solving computationally-limited scientific problems.

    abstract = {{The Kalman filter combines forecasts and new observations to obtain an
estimation which is optimal in the sense of a minimum average quadratic error.
The Kalman filter has two main restrictions: (i) the dynamical system is
assumed linear and (ii) forecasting errors and observational noises are taken
Gaussian. Here, we offer an important generalization to the case where errors
and noises have heavy tail distributions such as power laws and L\'evy laws.
The main tool needed to solve this ``Kalman-L\'evy'' filter is the
``tail-covariance'' matrix which generalizes the covariance matrix in the case
where it is mathematically ill-defined (i.e. for power law tail exponents \$\mu
\leq 2\$). We present the general solution and discuss its properties on
pedagogical examples. The standard Kalman-Gaussian filter is recovered for the
case \$\mu = 2\$. The optimal Kalman-L\'evy filter is found to deviate
substantially fro the standard Kalman-Gaussian filter as \$\mu\$ deviates from 2.
As \$\mu\$ decreases, novel observations are assimilated with less and less
weight as a small exponent \$\mu\$ implies large errors with significant
probabilities. In terms of implementation, the price-to-pay associated with the
presence of heavy tail noise distributions is that the standard linear
formalism valid for the Gaussian case is transformed into a nonlinear matrice
equation for the Kalman-L\'evy filter. Direct numerical experiments in the
univariate case confirms our theoretical predictions.}},

    abstract = {{Among target tracking algorithms using Kalman filtering-like approaches, the standard assumptions are Gaussian process and measurement noise models. Based on these assumptions, the Kalman filter is widely used in single or multiple filter versions (e.g., in an interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator). The oversimplification resulting from the above assumptions can cause degradation in tracking performance. In this paper we explore the application of Kalman-Levy filter to handle maneuvering targets. This filter assumes a heavy-tailed noise distribution known as the Levy distribution. Due to the heavy-tailed nature of the assumed distribution, the Kalman-Levy filter is more effective in the presence of large errors that can occur, for example, due to the onset of acceleration or deceleration. However, for the same reason, the performance of the Kalman-Levy filter in the nonmaneuvering portion of track is worse than that of a Kalman filter. For this reason, an IMM with one Kalman and one Kalman-Levy module is developed here. Also, the superiority of the IMM with Kalman-Levy module over only Kalman-filter-based IMM for realistic maneuvers is shown by simulation results.}},

    abstract = {{This paper focuses on dynamic capabilities and, more generally, the resource-based view of the firm. We argue that dynamic capabilities are a set of specific and identifiable processes such as product development, strategic decision making, and alliancing. They are neither vague nor tautological. Although dynamic capabilities are idiosyncratic in their details and path dependent in their emergence, they have significant commonalities across firms (popularly termed 'best practice'). This suggests that they are more homogeneous, fungible, equifinal, and substitutable than is usually assumed. In moderately dynamic markets, dynamic capabilities resemble the traditional conception of routines. They are detailed, analytic, stable processes with predictable outcomes. In contrast, in high-velocity markets, they are simple, highly experiential and fragile processes with unpredictable outcomes. Finally, well-known learning mechanisms guide the evolution of dynamic capabilities. In moderately dynamic markets, the evolutionary emphasis is on variation. In high-velocity markets, it is on selection. At the level of RBV, we conclude that traditional RBV misidentifies the locus of long-term competitive advantage in dynamic markets, overemphasizes the strategic logic of leverage, and reaches a boundary condition in high-velocity markets.

    abstract = {{In a number of natural and social systems, the response to an exogenous shock relaxes back to the average level according to a long-memory kernel \~{}1/t 1+θ with 0 ≤ θ < 1. In the presence of an epidemic-like process of triggered shocks developing in a cascade of generations at or close to criticality, this  ” bare” kernel is renormalized into an even slower decaying response function \~{}1/t 1-θ . Surprisingly, this means that the shorter the memory of the bare kernel (the larger 1+θ), the longer the memory of the response function (the smaller 1-θ). Here, we present a detailed investigation of this paradoxical behavior based on a generation-by-generation decomposition of the total response function, the use of Laplace transforms and of  ” anomalous” scaling arguments. The paradox is explained by the fact that the number of triggered generations grows anomalously with time at \~{} t θ so that the contributions of active generations up to time t more than compensate the shorter memory associated with a larger exponent θ. This anomalous scaling results fundamentally from the property that the expected waiting time is infinite for 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1. The techniques developed here are also applied to the case θ > 1 and we find in this case that the total renormalized response is a constant for t < 1/(1-n) followed by a cross-over to \~{}1/t 1+θ for t ≫ 1/(1-n).}},

We address this question by considering the process of transmission through a model population comprising social groups which follow simple dynamical rules for growth and breakup. Despite the simplicity of our model, the profiles produced bear a striking resemblance to a wide variety of real-world examples—in particular, empirical data that we have obtained for social (i.e., YouTube), financial (i.e., currency markets), and biological (i.e., colds in schools) systems. The observation of multiple resurgent peaks and abnormal decay times is qualitatively reproduced within the model simply by varying the time scales for group coalescence and fragmentation. We provide an approximate analytic treatment of the system and highlight a novel transition which arises as a result of the social group dynamics.}},

We find that these relaxation exponents cluster into three distinct classes and allow for the classification of collective human dynamics. This is consistent with an epidemic model on a social network containing two ingredients: a power-law distribution of waiting times between cause and action and an epidemic cascade of actions becoming the cause of future actions. This model is a conceptual extension of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to social systems [Ruelle, D (2004) Phys Today 57:48–53] and [Roehner BM, et al., (2004) Int J Mod Phys C 15:809–834], and provides a unique framework for the investigation of timing in complex systems.}},

@article{Gilson1998Legal,
    abstract = {{Recent scholarship has argued that the comparative success of the Silicon Valley high technology industrial district and failure of Route 128 outside of Boston, resulted from different patterns of inter-firm employee mobility which, in turn, led to differing  patterns of industrial organization: network organization as opposed to traditional vertical integration. The cause of the different patterns of employee mobility is said to be cultural differences between California and Massachusetts. This paper offers a different causal analysis. After reviewing the new economic geography's emphasis on inter-firm knowledge transfers as an agglomeration economy, I focus on the critical role of employee mobility -- the vehicle for inter-firm knowledge transfers -- in facilitating second-stage agglomeration economies: those that allow the district to transcend its original product cycle and reinvent itself. In this account, the legal rules governing employee mobility are a causal antecedent of the construction of each district's culture. In fact, California law prohibits the most effective means of protecting trade secrets embodied in tacit knowledge -- a contractual post-employment covenant not to compete. Massachusetts law, in contrast, allows their enforcement. Consistent with the new economic geography's emphasis on path dependence, the paper shows that California's unusual legal regime dates back to the early 1870's, a serendipitous result of the historical coincidence between the codification movement in the United States and the problems confronting a new state in developing a coherent legal system. The paper concludes with a cautionary note concerning the implications of the analysis for three related subjects: the standard law and economic prescription to fully protect property rights in intellectual property; a disturbing recent line of cases concerning claims of "inevitable disclosure" that threatens to turn trade secret law into the judicial equivalent of a covenant not to compete; and the right strategy for policy analysts assessing reform of a region's legal system to encourage high technology industrial districts.}},

The protection of cyberspace, the information medium, has become a vital national interest because of its importance both to the economy and to military power. An attacker may tamper with networks to steal information for money or to disrupt operations. Future wars are likely to be carried out, in part or perhaps entirely, in cyberspace. It might therefore seem obvious that maneuvering in cyberspace is like maneuvering in other media, but nothing would be more misleading. Cyberspace has its own laws. It is easy to hide identities and difficult to predict or even understand battle damage, and attacks deplete themselves quickly. Cyberwar is nothing so much as the manipulation of ambiguity. Martin Libicki explores these topics in detail and uses the results to address such issues as the pros and cons of counterattack, the value of deterrence and vigilance, and other actions the United States and the U.S. Air Force can take to protect itself in the face of deliberate cyberattack.}},

This process can create or destroy a social norm without changing individual values. In addition, law can change the individual values of rational people. Internalizing a social norm is a moral commitment that attaches a psychological penalty to a forbidden act. A rational person internalizes a norm when commitment conveys an advantage relative to the original preferences and the changed preferences. I call such a commitment a  ” Pareto self‐improvement.” By creating opportunities for Pareto selfimprovements, law induces rational people to change their preferences. Inducing change in this way respects individual preferences, rather favoring a particular moral theory.}},

How can a data holder release a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k- anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected. The k-anonymity protection model is important because it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly, µ-Argus and k-Similar provide guarantees of privacy protection.}},

These successes have led to the use of these techniques in criminal investigations and prosecutions.  However, few have studied adversarial attacks and their devastating effect on the robustness of existing classification methods. This paper presents a framework for adversarial attacks including obfuscation attacks, where a subject attempts to hide their identity imitation attacks, where a subject attempts to frame another subject by imitating their writing style.  The major contribution of this research is that it demonstrates that both attacks work very well.  The obfuscation attack reduces the effectiveness of the techniques to the level of random guessing and the imitation attack succeeds with 68-91\% probability depending on the stylometric technique used.  These results are made more significant by the fact that the experimental subjects were unfamiliar with stylometric techniques, without specialized knowledge in linguistics, and spent little time on the attacks. This paper also provides another significant contribution to the field in using human subjects to empirically validate the claim of high accuracy for current techniques (without attacks) by reproducing results for three representative stylometric methods.}},

    abstract = {{Contests are a historically important and increasingly popular mechanism for encouraging innovation. A central concern in designing innovation contests is how many competitors to admit. Using a unique data set of 9,661 software contests, we provide evidence of two coexisting and opposing forces that operate when the number of competitors increases. Greater rivalry reduces the incentives of all competitors in a contest to exert effort and make investments. At the same time, adding competitors increases the likelihood that at least one competitor will find an extreme-value solution. We show that the effort-reducing effect of greater rivalry dominates for less uncertain problems, whereas the effect on the extreme value prevails for more uncertain problems. Adding competitors thus systematically increases overall contest performance for high-uncertainty problems. We also find that higher uncertainty reduces the negative effect of added competitors on incentives. Thus, uncertainty and the nature of the problem should be explicitly considered in the design of innovation tournaments. We explore the implications of our findings for the theory and practice of innovation contests.}},

Typically, the underlying parameters (e.g., individual preferences) are unknown to the public authority. The implementation problem is then formulated: Under what circumstances can one design a mechanism so that the unknown information is truthfully elicited and the social optimum ends up being implemented? In designing such a mechanism, appropriate incentives must be given to the agents so that they do not wish to misrepresent their information. The theory of implementation or mechanism design formalizes this "social engineering" problem and provides answers to the question just posed. I survey the theory of implementation in this article, emphasizing the results under two different benchmarks (that agents have dominant strategies and that they play a Nash equilibrium). Examples discussed include voting, and the allocation of private and public goods under complete and incomplete information.}},

We also provide a mechanism for implementation in BRD if the rule is quasimonotonic and excludes worst alternatives – no worst alternative (NWA). Quasimonotonicity and NWA are both necessary and sufficient for absorbing implementation in BRD. Moreover, they characterize implementation in strict Nash equilibria. Under incomplete information, incentive compatibility is necessary for any kind of stable implementation in our sense, while Bayesian quasimonotonicity is necessary for recurrent implementation in interim BRD. Both conditions are also essentially sufficient for recurrent implementation, together with a Bayesian NWA. A characterization of implementation in strict Bayesian equilibria is also provided.

@misc{backstrom2011,
    abstract = {{Frigyes Karinthy, in his 1929 short story "L\'aancszemek" ("Chains")
suggested that any two persons are distanced by at most six friendship links.
(The exact wording of the story is slightly ambiguous: "He bet us that, using
no more than five individuals, one of whom is a personal acquaintance, he could
contact the selected individual [...]". It is not completely clear whether the
selected individual is part of the five, so this could actually allude to
distance five or six in the language of graph theory, but the "six degrees of
separation" phrase stuck after John Guare's 1990 eponymous play. Following
Milgram's definition and Guare's interpretation, we will assume that "degrees
of separation" is the same as "distance minus one", where "distance" is the
usual path length-the number of arcs in the path.) Stanley Milgram in his
famous experiment challenged people to route postcards to a fixed recipient by
passing them only through direct acquaintances. The average number of
intermediaries on the path of the postcards lay between 4.4 and 5.7, depending
on the sample of people chosen.


We report the results of the first world-scale social-network graph-distance
computations, using the entire Facebook network of active users (\approx721
million users, \approx69 billion friendship links). The average distance we
observe is 4.74, corresponding to 3.74 intermediaries or "degrees of
separation", showing that the world is even smaller than we expected, and
prompting the title of this paper. More generally, we study the distance
distribution of Facebook and of some interesting geographic subgraphs, looking
also at their evolution over time.


The networks we are able to explore are almost two orders of magnitude larger
than those analysed in the previous literature. We report detailed statistical
metadata showing that our measurements (which rely on probabilistic algorithms)
are very accurate.}},

It is not in the nature of cyberspace to be unregulable; cyberspace  has no "nature." It only has code-the software and hardware that make cyberspace  what it is. That code can create a place of freedom-as the original  architecture of the Net did-or a place of oppressive control. Under the  influence of commerce, cyberpsace is becoming a highly regulable space, where behavior is much  more tightly controlled than in real space. But that's not inevitable  either. We can-we must-choose what kind of cyberspace we want and what freedoms we  will guarantee. These choices are all about architecture: about what kind of code will govern cyberspace, and who will control it. In this  realm, code is the most significant form of law, and it is up to lawyers, policymakers, and especially citizens to decide what values that code  embodies. <P> Since its original publication, this seminal book has earned the status of  a minor classic. This second edition, or Version 2.0, has been prepared  through the author's wiki, a web site that allows readers to edit the  text, making this the first reader-edited revision of a popular book.}},

@article{anand2007,
    abstract = {{Like U.S. firms, many Canadian firms voluntarily restrict trading by corporate insiders beyond the requirements of insider trading law.  We aim to understand the determinants of firms' private insider trading policies (ITPs), which are quasi-contractual devices.  Based on the assumption that firms that face greater costs from insider trading (or greater benefits from restricting insider trading) ought to be more inclined than other firms to adopt ITPs or to adopt more stringent ITPs than other firms, we develop five hypotheses.  Specifically, we hypothesize that both ITP existence and ITP stringency are positively associated with a firm's size, market-to-book ratio, ownership and control concentration, firm-specific stock return volatility, and cross-listing in the U.S., where insider trading enforcement is more vigorous than in Canada.    We test our hypotheses using data from a sample of firms included in the Toronto Stock Exchange/Standard and Poor's (TSX/S\&P) Index.  Our results, which are robust to selection effects, support all but one of our hypotheses.  They suggest that Canadian firms do not randomly restrict insider trading, but rather do so predictably and with a predictable level of intensity.  They also suggest that neither window dressing, liability avoidance, nor U.S. regulatory imperialism fully explains Canadian firms' adoption of ITPs.  Rather, our results suggest that at least some firms and shareholders wish to control insider trading to enhance economic efficiency.  On balance, our findings suggest that some firms perceive insider trading to be harmful to their interests and thus challenge the claim that private restrictions of insider trading would not arise in the absence of insider trading laws.  Many Canadian firms privately restrict insider trading even though they face little threat of insider trading liability.  Finally, our results suggest that formal organizational rules may dominate private sanctions in this context, consistent with norms/trust theories of organizational rules rather than economic deterrence theories of such rules.}},

However, in the area of software engineering (and especially in the Open Source context) it seems that the literature has not yet taken into consideration the problem of identifying the process characteristics and performance of debugging. The aim of this paper is the identification of the performance characteristics of the bug fixing process of Open Source applications, focusing on continuity and efficiency indicators. The importance of such indicators is even more relevant today, since Open Source software is now adopted also in many business contexts. We have analyzed the debugging process of 9 active and popular Open Source projects, collecting a dataset comprising more than 65,000 closed bugs. Results have highlighted four types of bug fixing processes that can be distinguished by considering temporal continuity and efficiency dimensions.}},

An example of this rising phenomenon is to base software products on highly reusable open source components. In this scenario, the evolution of the software product is coupled with the evolution of the open source component. A common assumption is that component updates are immediately and regularly propagated to the project. This paper investigates this assumption empirically by studying update propagation practices in two popular open source libraries, zlib and FFmpeg. For each library, we analyze various repository sources with information such as bug reports, revision history, and source code. The results of the case studies suggest that update propagation is subject to several technical and non-technical factors including the way the open source library is used, the extent to which updates are documented, and the degree of community involvement. Based on these findings, we propose a set of recommendations that would allow better follow-up of updates and smoother update propagation.}},

In contrast, legal realists argue that the rational application of legal reasons does not sufficiently explain the decisions of judges and that psychological, political, and social factors influence judicial rulings. We test the common caricature of realism that justice is  ” what the judge ate for breakfast” in sequential parole decisions made by experienced judges. We record the judges' two daily food breaks, which result in segmenting the deliberations of the day into three distinct  ” decision sessions.” We find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ≈65\% to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ≈65\% after a break. Our findings suggest that judicial rulings can be swayed by extraneous variables that should have no bearing on legal decisions.}},

To determine whether high performing player strategies could be collectively codified, we augmented the Foldit gameplay mechanics with tools for players to encode their folding strategies as  ” recipes” and to share their recipes with other players, who are able to further modify and redistribute them. Here we describe the rapid social evolution of player-developed folding algorithms that took place in the year following the introduction of these tools. Players developed over 5,400 different recipes, both by creating new algorithms and by modifying and recombining successful recipes developed by other players. The most successful recipes rapidly spread through the Foldit player population, and two of the recipes became particularly dominant. Examination of the algorithms encoded in these two recipes revealed a striking similarity to an unpublished algorithm developed by scientists over the same period. Benchmark calculations show that the new algorithm independently discovered by scientists and by Foldit players outperforms previously published methods. Thus, online scientific game frameworks have the potential not only to solve hard scientific problems, but also to discover and formalize effective new strategies and algorithms.}},

Specifically, using the case of the Linux kernel development project, we build a model of community-based, evolutionary knowledge creation to study how thousands of talented volunteers, dispersed across organizational and geographical boundaries, collaborate via the Internet to produce a knowledge-intensive, innovative product of high quality. By comparing and contrasting the Linux model with the traditional/commercial model of software development and firmbased knowledge creation efforts, we show how the proposed model of knowledge creation expands beyond the boundary of the firm. Our model suggests that the product development process can be effectively organized as an evolutionary process of learning driven by criticism and error correction. We conclude by offering some theoretical implications of our community-based model of knowledge creation for the literature of organizational learning, community life, and the uses of knowledge in society.}},

    abstract = {{Open source software (OSS) is a social and economic phenomenon that raises fundamental questions about
the motivations of contributors to information systems development. Some developers are unpaid volunteers
who seek to solve their own technical problems, while others create OSS as part of their employment contract.
For the past 10 years, a substantial amount of academic work has theorized about and empirically examined
developer motivations. We review this work and suggest considering motivation in terms of the values of the
social practice in which developers participate. Based on the social philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre, we
construct a theoretical framework that expands our assumptions about individual motivation to include the idea
of a long-term, value-informed quest beyond short-term rewards. This motivation–practice framework depicts
how the social practice and its supporting institutions mediate between individual motivation and outcome.
The framework contains three theoretical conjectures that seek to explain how collectively elaborated standards
of excellence prompt developers to produce high-quality software, change institutions, and sustain OSS
development. From the framework, we derive six concrete propositions and suggest a new research agenda
on motivation in OSS.}},

However, why individuals help strangers in these electronic networks is not well understood: there is no immediate benefit to the contributor, and free-riders are able to acquire the same knowledge as everyone else. To understand this paradox, we apply theories of collective action to examine how individual motivations and social capital influence knowledge contribution in electronic networks. This study reports on the activities of one electronic network supporting a professional legal association. Using archival, network, survey, and content analysis data, we empirically test a model of knowledge contribution. We find that people contribute their knowledge when they perceive that it enhances their professional reputations, when they have the experience to share, and when they are structurally embedded in the network. Surprisingly, contributions occur without regard to expectations of reciprocity from others or high levels of commitment to the network.}},

Instead, it focuses on the history and philosophy of open-source software (previously referred to as <I>freeware</I>) as an argument for shaping the future of programming. <I>Open Sources</I> is much larger than just a fight with any one company. Instead, it is a revolutionary call to release software development from the vested interests that label new directions in software development as threatening.<p> This is not to say that opening the source code is an entirely egalitarian and communistic endeavor.

    abstract = {{Understanding what motivates participation is a central theme in the research on open source software (OSS) development. Our study contributes by revealing how the different motivations of OSS developers are interrelated, how these motivations influence participation leading to performance, and how past performance influences subsequent motivations. Drawing on theories of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, we develop a theoretical model relating the motivations, participation, and performance of OSS developers. We evaluate our model using survey and archival data collected from a longitudinal field study of software developers in the Apache projects. Our results reveal several important findings. First, we find that developers' motivations are not independent but rather are related in complex ways. Being paid to contribute to Apache projects is positively related to developers' status motivations but negatively related to their use-value motivations. Perhaps surprisingly, we find no evidence of diminished intrinsic motivation in the presence of extrinsic motivations; rather, status motivations enhance intrinsic motivations. Second, we find that different motivations have an impact on participation in different ways. Developers' paid participation and status motivations lead to above-average contribution levels, but use-value motivations lead to below-average contribution levels, and intrinsic motivations do not significantly impact average contribution levels. Third, we find that developers' contribution levels positively impact their performance rankings. Finally, our results suggest that past-performance rankings enhance developers' subsequent status motivations.}},

    abstract = {{Open source software projects rely on the voluntary efforts of thousands of software developers, yet we know little about why developers choose to participate in this collective development process. This paper inductively derives a framework for understanding participation from the perspective of the individual software developer based on data from two software communities with different governance structures.

In both communities, a need for software-related improvements drives initial participation. The majority of participants leave the community once their needs are met, however, a small subset remains involved. For this set of developers, motives evolve over time and participation becomes a hobby. These hobbyists are critical to the long-term viability of the software code: They take on tasks that might otherwise go undone and work to maintain the simplicity and modularity of the code. Governance structures affect this evolution of motives. Implications for firms interested in implementing hybrid strategies designed to combine the advantages of open source software development with proprietary ownership and control are discussed.}},

But no one has systematically examined whether a similar kind of  ” collective intelligence” exists for groups of people. In two studies with 699 people, working in groups of two to five, we find converging evidence of a general collective intelligence factor that explains a group's performance on a wide variety of tasks. This  ” c factor” is not strongly correlated with the average or maximum individual intelligence of group members but is correlated with the average social sensitivity of group members, the equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking, and the proportion of females in the group.}},

    abstract = {{How do real graphs evolve over time? What are "normal" growth patterns in social, technological, and information networks? Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network, or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time.Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time, with the number of edges growing super-linearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time, in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)).Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior, even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a "forest fire" spreading process, that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the "flammability" of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study.}},

    abstract = {{This paper is a contribution to the 2nd edition of Craig and de B\'{u}rca, The Evolution of EU Law. It highlights key trends in EU law in the last ten to fifteen years, as regards the regulation of network industries and of services of general economic interest (SGEIs) more generally. Our central claim is that over the relevant period of time, EU law has been – and still is – in the process of moving from one legal paradigm to another. The first paradigm is more traditional, static, formalistic and self-contained (mono-disciplinary). Its hallmark is the use of legal definitions and concepts to create categories in which phenomena are placed, by way of pigeonholing or labeling, and to which consequences are attached. It was more appropriate in earlier times when EU law was concerned with establishing market access and realizing the Internal Market. The second paradigm is more dynamic, integrative and inter-disciplinary. Its hallmark is the use of general guidelines and principles to assess specific situations in a wider sectoral setting, with progressive refinement, until the point where a conclusion can be reached and consequences attached. It leads to 'managed competition', where EU law integrates other objectives besides market access.  As for substantive law, EU electronic communications law, since 2002, presents the best – albeit not complete – example of the new paradigm, with its reliance on technological neutrality and economic analysis. EU energy law has not gone as far down that path. Interestingly, the ECJ judgment in Altmark can be seen as an attempt to steer the law concerning SGEIs away from formalism, towards the new paradigm. However, developments following Altmark show that the other institutions have not fully followed the ECJ.  As for institutions, EU electronic communications and energy law have followed a similar path, away from formalistic separations (i) between EU and Member State institutions, (ii) along national borders or (iii) between regulation and competition law. At the same time, the separation between the regulatory authority and the national legislative and executive powers has been strengthened. The policing of SGEIs under Article 106(2) TFEU would benefit from following a similar institutional path.}},

We report data from an experiment aimed at determining the relative importance of intentions and incentives in producing non-cooperative behavior. Participants play a one-shot investment experiment in pairs. Investors send an amount to trustees, request a return on this investment and, in some treatments, can threaten sanctions to enforce their requests. Decisions by trustees facing threats imposed (or not) by investors are compared to decisions by trustees facing threats imposed (or not) by nature. When not threatened, trustees typically decide to return a positive amount less than the investor requested. When threatened this decision becomes least common. If the request is large relative to the sanction then most trustees return nothing. If the request is small, trustees typically return the requested amount. These results do not vary with investors' intentions.}},

We present the result of a field study in a group of day‐care centers that contradicts this prediction. Parents used to arrive late to collect their children, forcing a teacher to stay after closing time. We introduced a monetary fine for late‐coming parents. As a result, the number of late‐coming parents increased significantly. After the fine was removed no reduction occurred. We argue that penalties are usually introduced into an incomplete contract, social or private. They may change the information that agents have, and therefore the effect on behavior may be opposite of that expected. If this is true, the deterrence hypothesis loses its predictive strength, since the clause  ” everything else is left unchanged” might be hard to satisfy.}},

@article{scott2003,
    abstract = {{All contracts are incomplete.  But incomplete contracts differ along several key dimensions.  Many contracts are incomplete because parties decline to condition performance on future states that they cannot observe or verify to courts.  In these cases, the incompleteness is exogenous to the contract.  Other agreements, however, appear to be "deliberately" incomplete in the sense that parties decline to condition performance on available, verifiable measures that could be specified in the contract at relatively low cost.  Thus, incompleteness is endogenous to these agreements suggesting that the parties had other reasons for leaving the terms in question unspecified.    Traditional contract law doctrine appears to track this distinction.  One of the core principles of contact law is the requirement of definiteness. An agreement will not be enforced as a contract if it is uncertain and indefinite in its material terms.  It is widely believed, however, that the indefiniteness doctrine is largely ignored by contemporary courts.  But a study of the contemporary case law on indefinite contracts reveals some striking facts.  In literally dozens of cases, American courts dismiss claims for breach of contract on the grounds of indefiniteness, often without granting any relief to the disappointed promisee. This evidence raises a fundamental question: Why do parties write deliberately incomplete agreements in the shadow of a robust indefiniteness doctrine?  One hypothesis is that these agreements may be self-enforcing.  But most of the recently litigated cases do not appear to be self-enforcing in the traditional sense.  Rather, most are isolated transactions between strangers trading at arms length.  Recent work in experimental economics suggests, however, that the domain of self-enforcing contracts may be considerably larger than has been conventionally understood.  A robust result of these experiments is that a significant fraction of individuals behave as if reciprocity were an important motivation (even in isolated interactions with strangers) while a comparable fraction react as if motivated entirely by self interest.  These experiments support a theory that predicts that deliberately incomplete contracts that rely on self-enforcement through reciprocal fairness are more efficient than the alternative of more complete, legally enforceable agreements.  The potency of reciprocal fairness as a method of self-enforcement explains (and justifies) the resiliency of the common law indefiniteness doctrine in the face of a contemporary academic consensus in favor of expanding the scope of legal regulation.}},

Security patterns have shown how reoccurring problems can be best solved with proven solutions. However, while they are critical for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computing systems, security patterns do not specifically (or necessarily) address the privacy of individuals. Building on existing privacy pattern work, we identify three privacy patterns for web-based activity: INFORMED CONSENT FOR WEB-BASED TRANSACTIONS, MASKED ONLINE TRAFFIC, and MINIMAL INFORMATION ASYMMETRY. The first pattern addresses a system architecture issue and draws on Friedman's model for informed consent. The second and third patterns provide support for end users and extend Jiang's 'Principle of Minimum Asymmetry.' These patterns describe how users can protect their privacy by both revealing less about themselves, and acquiring more information from the party with whom they are communicating.}},

    abstract = {{Online privacy policies are difficult to understand. Most privacy policies require a college reading level and an ability to decode legalistic, confusing, or jargon-laden phrases. Privacy researchers and industry groups have devised several standardized privacy policy formats to address these issues and help people compare policies. We evaluated three formats in this paper: layered policies, which present a short form with standardized components in addition to a full policy; the Privacy Finder privacy report, which standardizes the text descriptions of privacy practices in a brief bulleted format; and conventional non-standardized human-readable policies. We contrasted six companies' policies, deliberately selected to span the range from unusually readable to challenging. Based on the results of our online study of 749 Internet users, we found participants were not able to reliably understand companies' privacy practices with any of the formats. Compared to natural language, participants were faster with standardized formats but at the expense of accuracy for layered policies. Privacy Finder formats supported accuracy more than natural language for harder questions. Improved readability scores did not translate to improved performance. All formats and policies were similarly disliked. We discuss our findings as well as public policy implications.}},

    abstract = {{Rapidly innovating industries are not behaving the way theory expects. Conventional industrial organization theory predicts that, when parties in a supply chain have to make transaction-specific investments, the risk of opportunism will drive them away from contracts and toward vertical integration. Despite the conventional theory, however, contemporary practice is moving in the other direction. Instead of vertical integration, we observe vertical disintegration in a significant number of industries, as producers recognize that they cannot themselves maintain cutting-edge technology in every field required for the success of their products. In doing this, the parties are developing forms of contracting beyond the reach of contract theory models. In this Article, we connect the emerging contract practice to theory, learning from what has happened in the real world to frame a theoretical explanation of this cross-organizational innovation and to reconceptualize the boundaries of the firm accordingly. We argue that the vertical disintegration of the supply chain in many industries is mediated neither by fully specified technical interfaces that allow suppliers to produce a modular piece of the ultimate product, nor by entirely implicit relational contracts supported only by norms of reciprocity and the expectation of future dealings. Rather, we suggest that the change in the boundary of the firm has given rise to a new form of contracting between firms—what we call  ” contracting for innovation.” This pattern braids explicit and implicit contracting to support iterative collaborative innovation by raising switching costs. These costs, represented by the parties' parallel transaction-specific investments in knowledge about their collaborators' capacities, deter opportunism under circumstances where explicit contracting, renegotiation, and the anticipation of future dealings cannot.}},

    abstract = {{This article studies the relationship between formal contract enforcement, where performance is encouraged by the prospect of judicial intervention, and informal enforcement, where performance is motivated by the threat of lost reputation and expected future dealings or a taste for reciprocity. The incomplete contracting literature treats the two strategies as separate phenomena. By contrast, a rich experimental literature considers whether the introduction of formal contracting and state enforcement  ” crowds out” or degrades the operation of informal contracting. Both literatures, however, focus too narrowly on formal contracts as a system of incentives for inducing parties to perform substantive actions, while assuming that the effectiveness of informal enforcement depends on pre-existing levels of trust. As a result, current scholarship misses the relationship between formal and informal contract mechanisms characteristic of contemporary contracting in practice. Parties are  responding to rising uncertainty by writing contracts that intertwine formal and informal mechanisms – what we call  ” braiding” – in a way that allows each to assess the disposition and capacity of the other to respond cooperatively and effectively to unforeseen circumstances. These parties agree on formal contracts for exchanging information about the progress and prospects of their joint activities, and it is this information sharing regime that  ” braids” the formal and informal elements of the contract and endogenizes trust. We argue that the low-powered enforcement associated with the formal governance structure in these braided contracts complements rather than crowds out the informal mechanisms that rely on increasing levels of trust. We examine the braiding phenomenon in a variety of contexts characterized by rising uncertainty. These range from the uncertainties of technological innovation to commercial ventures and corporate acquisitions where the uncertainty centers on the importance of the search for new partners. In each instance, courts appear to have harnessed the braiding phenomenon by using low-powered sanctions to protect formal contractual  ” preliminaries” without creating potential liability that will crowd out informal contracting. This technique allows potential collaborators to explore and develop their relations but it does not impose mutually enforceable obligations to pursue a particular project.  But despite the wisdom of temperate enforcement of braided contracts, courts that emphasize the contemporary duty to negotiate in good faith are often tempted to expand the legal sanction and thereby unwittingly undermine the very informal arrangements that braided obligations are designed to support. We conclude, therefore, by explaining how courts can best support the braiding strategies that are critical to the success of an integrated regime of formal and informal contracting.}},

    abstract = {{Contract today increasingly links entrepreneurial innovations to the efforts and finance necessary to transform ideas into value. In this Chapter, we describe the match between a form of contract that  "braids"  formal and informal contractual elements in novel ways and the process by which innovation is pursued.  It is hardly surprising that these innovative forms of contract have emerged first in markets, and that the common law, and the theory of contract, then play catch-up. Between the time contracting practice adapts to the demands of innovation and the time contract doctrine adapts to the demands of practice, law acts as a friction on the innovation process rather than a lubricant to it.  Our goal here is to reduce that lag by providing a theory that can guide courts in developing case law that addresses current forms of innovation This chapter provides an overview of our ongoing work.   The starting point is the Knightian distinction between risk and uncertainty.   In our view, traditional contracting techniques and traditional contract law address problems of risk.  Braiding, or contracting for innovation, addresses conditions of uncertainty. We illustrate the relevance of this distinction by describing the shift in the organizational location of innovation - in particular a fundamental shift from vertical integration to contract as the organizing mechanism for cutting-edge innovation.   We then describe the braiding of formal and informal contracting that has developed to organize collaboration across organizational boundaries where the desired outcome can, at best, be anticipated only very approximately.  Next, we re-examine the interaction between formal and informal contracting to understand why braiding was not envisaged as a theoretical possibility before it became a salient reality, and to make theoretical sense of braiding now that it has.  Finally, we look to recent case law, especially that considering preliminary agreements, to argue that the domain of braiding now includes contexts where uncertainty is not generated by technological development, and we examine the failure of courts to recognize the difference between and consequences of low-powered and high-powered enforcement in addressing braided contracts.}},

We present a test for the occurrence of power-law tails in statistical distributions based on maximum entropy. This methodology allows one to identify the true data-generating processes even in the case when it is neither lognormal nor Pareto. The maximum entropy approach is then compared with other widely used methods and applied to different levels of aggregation of complex systems. Our results provide support for the theory that distributions with lognormal body and Pareto tail can be generated as mixtures of lognormally distributed units.}},

    abstract = {{Many markets have historically been dominated by a small number of best-selling products. The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, describes this common pattern of sales concentration. However, by greatly lowering search costs, information technology in general and Internet markets in particular have the potential to substantially increase the collective share of niche products, thereby creating a longer tail in the distribution of sales. 	 This paper investigates how demand-side factors contribute to the Internet's ¿Long Tail¿ phenomenon. It first models how a reduction in search costs will affect the concentration in product sales. Then, by analyzing data collected from a multi-channel retailing company, it provides empirical evidence that the Internet channel exhibits a significantly less concentrated sales distribution, when compared with traditional channels. The difference in the sales distribution is highly significant, even after controlling for consumer differences. Furthermore, the effect is particularly strong for individuals with more prior experience using the Internet channel.  We find evidence that Internet purchases made by consumers with prior Internet experience are more skewed toward obscure products, compared with consumers who have no such experience.  We observe the opposite outcome when comparing purchases by the same consumers through the catalog channel. If the relationships we uncover persist, the underlying trends in technology and search costs portend an ongoing shift in the distribution of product sales.}},

    abstract = {{Complex systems consist of many interacting elements which participate in some dynamical process. The activity of various elements is often different and the fluctuation in the activity of an element grows monotonically with the average activity. This relationship is often of the form fluctuations \&ap; constant × average<sup>\&agr;</sup>, where the exponent \&agr; is predominantly in the range [1/2, 1]. This power law has been observed in a very wide range of disciplines, ranging from population dynamics through the Internet to the stock market and it is often treated under the names <i>Taylor's law</i> or <i>fluctuation scaling</i>. This review attempts to show how general the above scaling relationship is by surveying the literature, as well as by reporting some new empirical data and model calculations. We also show some basic principles that can underlie the generality of the phenomenon. This is followed by a mean-field framework based on sums of random variables. In this context the emergence of fluctuation scaling is equivalent to some corresponding limit theorems. In certain physical systems fluctuation scaling can be related to finite size scaling.}},

    abstract = {{This Article reports an empirical study of the network composed of patent  ” nodes” and citation  ” links” between them. It builds on an earlier study in which we argued that trends in the growth of the patent citation network provide evidence that the explosive growth in patenting in the late twentieth century was due at least in part to the issuance of increasingly trivial patents. We defined a measure of patent stratification based on comparative probability of citation; an increase in this measure suggests that the USPTO is issuing patents of comparatively less technological significance. Provocatively, we found that stratification increased in the 1990s during the  ” patent explosion.” Here we report a further study indicating that the trend toward increasing stratification leveled off beginning around 2000. This observation suggests that there was a de facto tightening of patentability standards well before the doctrinal shifts reflected in the Supreme Court's flurry of patent activity beginning around 2005. We also investigate the possibility that changes in our measure of stratification are due to something other than changes in patentability standards. While not conclusive, our results suggest that neither shifts in predominance of technological areas nor changes in citation practice account for our observations. We have thus identified an apparent puzzle: What happened around 2000 to cause a de facto tightening of patentability standards at the USPTO?}},

    abstract = {{The network may be the metaphor of the present era. A network, consisting of  ” nodes” and  ” links,” may be a group of individuals linked by friendship; a group of computers linked by network cables; a system of roads or airline flights -- or another of a virtually limitless variety of systems of connected  ” things.” The past few years have seen an explosion of interest in  ” network science,” which seeks to move beyond metaphor to analysis in fields from physics to sociology. Network science highlights the role of relationship patterns in determining collective behavior. It underscores and begins to address the difficulty of predicting collective behavior from individual interactions. This Article seeks first to describe how network science can provide new conceptual and empirical approaches to legal questions because of its focus on analyzing the effects of patterns of relationships on collective behavior. The Article then illustrates the network approach by describing a study of the network created by patents and the citations between them. Burgeoning patenting has raised concerns about patent quality, reflected in proposed legislation and in renewed Supreme Court attention to patent law. The network approach allows us to get behind the increasing numbers and investigate the patterns of relationships between patented technologies. We can then distinguish between faster technological progress, increasing breadth of patented technologies, and a lower patentability standard as possible explanations for increased patenting. We find that, since the late 1980s, the disparity in likelihood of citation between the most  ” citable” and least  ” citable” patents has grown, suggesting that the least citable patents may represent increasingly trivial inventions. One possible explanation of this increasing stratification is increasing reliance by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals on the widely criticized  ” motivation or suggestion to combine” test for nonobviousness, which is at issue in the case of KSR v. Teleflex, currently pending at the Supreme Court. We also discuss how network science may be employed to address other issues of patent law.}},

We find that the typical venture-backed entrepreneur received an average of \$5.8 million in exit cash. Almost three-quarters of entrepreneurs receive nothing at exit and a few receive over a billion dollars. Because of the extreme dispersion of payoffs, an entrepreneur with a coefficient of relative risk aversion of two places a certainty equivalent value only slightly greater than zero on the distribution of outcomes she faces at the time of her company's launch.

We argue that the assets and capabilities needed to produce one good are imperfect substitutes for those needed to produce other goods, but the degree of asset specificity varies widely. Given this, the speed of structural transformation will depend on the density of the product space near the area where each country has developed its comparative advantage. While this space is traditionally assumed to be smooth and continuous, we find that in fact it is very heterogeneous, with some areas being very dense and others quite sparse. We develop a measure of revealed proximity between products using comparative advantage in order to map this space, and then show that its heterogeneity is not without consequence. The speed at which countries can transform their productive structure and upgrade their exports depends on having a path to nearby goods that are increasingly of higher value.

It pervades cultural markets, and manifests itself in the adoption of scientific and technical innovations as well as the spread of social practices. Prior empirical work on the diffusion of innovations in spatial regions or social networks has largely focused on the spread of one particular technology among a subset of all potential adopters. Here we choose an online context that allows us to study social influence processes by tracking the popularity of a complete set of applications installed by the user population of a social networking site, thus capturing the behavior of all individuals who can influence each other in this context. By extending standard fluctuation scaling methods, we analyze the collective behavior induced by 100 million application installations, and show that two distinct regimes of behavior emerge in the system. Once applications cross a particular threshold of popularity, social influence processes induce highly correlated adoption behavior among the users, which propels some of the applications to extraordinary levels of popularity. Below this threshold, the collective effect of social influence appears to vanish almost entirely, in a manner that has not been observed in the offline world. Our results demonstrate that even when external signals are absent, social influence can spontaneously assume an on–off nature in a digital environment. It remains to be seen whether a similar outcome could be observed in the offline world if equivalent experimental conditions could be replicated.}},

Despite the importance of the license type and developers to OSS projects, there is little understanding in open source literature of the license choice from a developer's perspective. The results from our empirical study of OSS developers reveal that the intrinsic motivation of challenge (problem solving) is associated with the developers' preference for licenses with moderate restrictions, while the extrinsic motivation of status (through peer recognition) is associated with developers' preference for licenses with least restrictions. We also find that when choosing an OSS license, a developer's attitude toward the software redistribution rights conflicts with his or her attitude toward preserving the social benefits of open source. A major implication of our findings is that OSS managers who want to attract a limited number of highly skilled programmers to their open source project should choose a restrictive OSS license. Similarly, managers of software projects for social programs could attract more developers by choosing a restrictive OSS license.}},

We also show that developer and non-developer interest in the OSS project and the project activity levels in any time period significantly affect the project success measures in subsequent time period.

    abstract = {{The Open Source Software (OSS) development model has emerged as an important competing paradigm to proprietary alternatives; however, insufficient research exists to understand the influence of some OSS project characteristics on the level of activity of the development process. A basic such characteristic is the selection of the project's software license. Drawing upon social movement theory, our study examined the relationship between OSS licenses and project activity. Some OSS licenses include a  ” copyleft” clause, which requires that if derivative products are to be released, it must be done under the license the original product had. We hypothesize that copylefted licenses, as opposed to noncopylefted licenses, are associated with higher developer membership and coding activity, faster development speed, and longer developer permanence in the project. To test the hypotheses, we used archival data sources of working OSS projects spanning several years of development time. We discuss practical and theoretical implications of the results as well as future research ideas.

It argues against adopting fundamentalist viewpoints in the DRM policy debate. In particular, DRM technology is much more flexible than many DRM critics acknowledge. The article covers various problems that are less frequently discussed in legal and policy circles. It analyzes the relationship between DRM, fair use, and innovation, using rights locker architectures, dynamic DRM systems, the Creative Commons project, DRM technology license agreements, and security research as examples. It addresses the alleged dichotomy between DRM and copyright levy systems as well as the implications of DRM for privacy protection. By analyzing various technology platforms, it describes the implications DRM has for competition in platform markets as well as in complementary aftermarkets. Finally, the article assesses recent efforts to standardize DRM technology, both by the private sector (in particular TCPA/TCG and Palladium/NGSCB), and by the legislature.}},

However, we show that when the audio is encoded using variable bit rate codecs, the lengths of encrypted VoIP packets can be used to identify the phrases spoken within a call. Our results indicate that a passive observer can identify phrases from a standard speech corpus within encrypted calls with an average accuracy of 50\%, and with accuracy greater than 90\% for some phrases. Clearly, such an attack calls into question the efficacy of current VoIP encryption standards. In addition, we examine the impact of various features of the underlying audio on our performance and discuss methods for mitigation.}},

The embedding process creates a stego medium by replacing these redundant bits with data from the hidden message.

In 1994, in keeping with law enforcement's efforts to have laws stay current with changing technologies, Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA). This controversial law, which mandated that digitally-switched telephone networks must be built wiretap compatible, was not easily implemented. Now the FBI is seeking to extend CALEA to Voice over IP (VoIP). Such an application is less than straightforward and in the current communications environment, with an unsecured Internet upon which critical infrastructure depending heavily, building surveillance technology directly into Internet protocols may have very negative national-security implications.

                Complex networks are studied across many fields of science. To uncover their structural design principles, we defined "network motifs," patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.

Extant research proposes financial rewards as suitable management practice, maintaining that extrinsic financial rewards and intrinsic motivation have a unidimensionally positive effect on volunteers' motivation. In contrast, using the same theory underlying these studies, we argue that the effect of payment is far more complex. To do so, we introduce the concept of payment norms as a moderator of the effect of payment on motivation. Conducting a scenario experiment with open source software developers, we find that intrinsic motivation decreases for individuals with norms against payment, and that self-determination mediates this effect. Furthermore, payment has a direct positive effect on total motivation, but not for individuals with strong norms for payment. Our findings help explain conflicting earlier results on motivation crowding and contribute to the debate on how to manage external volunteers in distributed innovation settings.}},

This regulation prohibits Internet service providers, such as Verizon or Comcast, from discriminating in favor of traffic or content which they own or with which they are affiliated. Professor Barbara van Schewick's recently published book, Internet Architecture and Innovation, could not be timelier. Employing a variety of economic and technical arguments, van Schewick defends the type of regulation the FCC passed as necessary to preserve the Internet's potential for innovation.      My central critique of Internet Architecture is its deployment of economic theories on one side of a highly politicized debate, rather than using economic analysis to elevate that debate. Van Schewick relies on an impressive array of economic approaches but fails to acknowledge their ambiguity. Her argument strings together a succession of questionable economic generalizations, thereby greatly weakening her conclusions.  Van Schewick is not alone in using economics in this way. Too many law professors rely on theoretical models but ignore their limiting assumptions, failing to sort through the massive ambiguity inherent in their application. A close examination of van Schewick's argument, therefore, leads to general recommendations for legal interdisciplinary research method.}},

                     of these probabilities, we can reconstruct the functions associated with the characteristics of earthquake clusters to test
                     a number of important hypotheses about the earthquake clustering phenomena. We applied this reconstruction method to the shallow
                     seismic data in Japan and also to a simulated catalogue. The results show the following assertions: (1) The functions for
                     each component in the formulation of the space-time ETAS model are good enough as a first-order approximation for describing
                     earthquake clusters; (2) a background event triggers less offspring in expectation than a triggered event of the same magnitude;
                     (3) the magnitude distribution of the triggered event depends on the magnitude of its direct ancestor; (4) the diffusion of
                     the aftershock sequence is mainly caused by cascades of individual triggering processes, while no evidence shows that each
                     individual triggering process is diffusive; and (5) the scale of the triggering region is still an exponential law, as formulated
                     in the model but not the same one for the expected number of offspring.

    abstract = {{This article is concerned with objective estimation of the spatial intensity function of the background earthquake occurrences from an earthquake catalog that includes numerous clustered events in space and time, and also with an algorithm for producing declustered catalogs from the original catalog. A space-time branching process model (the ETAS model) is used for describing how each event generates offspring events. It is shown that the background intensity function can be evaluated if the total spatial seismicity intensity and the branching structure can be estimated. In fact, the whole space-time process is split into two subprocesses, the background events and the clustered events. The proposed algorithm combines a parametric maximum likelihood estimate for the clustering structures using the space-time ETAS model and a nonparametric estimate of the background seismicity that we call a variable weighted kernel estimate. To demonstrate the present methods, we estimate the background seismic activities in the central region of New Zealand and in the central and western regions of Japan, then use these estimates to produce catalogs of background events.}},

    abstract = {{Even though people in our contemporary technological society are depending on communication, our understanding of the underlying laws of human communicational behavior continues to be poorly understood. Here we investigate the communication patterns in 2 social Internet communities in search of statistical laws in human interaction activity. This research reveals that human communication networks dynamically follow scaling laws that may also explain the observed trends in economic growth. Specifically, we identify a generalized version of Gibrat's law of social activity expressed as a scaling law between the fluctuations in the number of messages sent by members and their level of activity. Gibrat's law has been essential in understanding economic growth patterns, yet without an underlying general principle for its origin. We attribute this scaling law to long-term correlation patterns in human activity, which surprisingly span from days to the entire period of the available data of more than 1 year. Further, we provide a mathematical framework that relates the generalized version of Gibrat's law to the long-term correlated dynamics, which suggests that the same underlying mechanism could be the source of Gibrat's law in economics, ranging from large firms, research and development expenditures, gross domestic product of countries, to city population growth. These findings are also of importance for designing communication networks and for the understanding of the dynamics of social systems in which communication plays a role, such as economic markets and political systems.}},

Earthquake forecasting, too, suffers from measurement errors and partial model information and may thus gain significantly from data assimilation. We present perhaps the first fully implementable data assimilation method for earthquake forecasts generated by a point-process model of seismicity. We test the method on a synthetic and pedagogical example of a renewal process observed in noise, which is relevant for the seismic gap hypothesis, models of characteristic earthquakes and recurrence statistics of large quakes inferred from paleoseismic data records. To address the non-Gaussian statistics of earthquakes, we use sequential Monte Carlo methods, a set of flexible simulation-based methods for recursively estimating arbitrary posterior distributions. We perform extensive numerical simulations to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of forecasting earthquakes based on data assimilation.}},

    abstract = {{The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to conceptually understand membership dynamics in the open source software (OSS) community, and (2) to explore how different network characteristics (i.e., network size and connectivity) influence the stability of an OSS network. Through the lens of Ising theory, which is widely accepted in physics, we investigate basic patterns of interaction and present fresh conceptual insight into dynamic and reciprocal relations among OSS community members. We also perform computer simulations based on empirical data collected from two actual OSS communities. Key findings include: (1) membership herding is highly present when external influences (e.g., the availability of other OSS projects) are weak, but decreases significantly when external influences increase, (2) propensity for membership herding is most likely to be seen in a large network with random connectivity, and (3) for large networks, when external influences are weak, random connectivity will result in higher network strength than scale-free connectivity (as external influences increase, however, the reverse phenomenon is observed). In addition, scale-free connectivity appears to be less volatile than random connectivity in response to an increase in the strength of external influences. We conclude with several implications that may be of significance to OSS stakeholders in particular, and to a broader range of online communities in general.}},

We argue that such systems offer benefits on both the demand side and the supply side. Supply-side benefits include the potential for autonomous innovation, which is driven by the division of labor and provides the opportunity lor rapid trial-and-error learning. Demund-side benefits include the ability to fine-tune the product to consumer needs and therefore blanket the product space more completely. Both of our case studies suggest that innovation in a modular system can lead to vertical and horizontal disintegration, as firms can often best appropriate the rents of innovation by opening their technology to an outside network of competing and cooperating firms. We conclude by speculating on the increased importance of modular systems in the future, since flexible manufacturing and rising incomes are likely to increase the driving requisites of modular systems: low economies of scale in assembly and sophisticated consumer tastes.}},

@article{poortinga2004,
    abstract = {{Within the risk literature there is an ongoing debate on whether trust is vulnerable or enduring. Previous research on nuclear energy by Slovic in 1993 has shown that negative events have much greater impact on self-reported trust than do positive events. Slovic attributes this to the asymmetry principle: specifically, that trust is much easier to destroy than to create. In a questionnaire survey concerning genetically modified (GM) food in Britain (n= 396) we similarly find that negative events have a greater impact on trust than positive events. Because public opinion in Britain is skewed in the direction of opposition toward GM food, the pattern of results could either be caused by the fact that negative information is more informative than positive information (a negativity bias) or reflect the influence of people's prior attitudes toward the issue (a confirmatory bias). The results were largely in line with the confirmatory bias hypothesis: participants with clear positive or negative beliefs interpreted events in line with their existing attitude position. However, for participants with intermediate attitudes, negative items still had greater impact than the positive. This latter finding suggests that, congruent with the negativity bias hypothesis, negative information may still be more informative than positive information for undecided people. The study also identified the labeling of GM products, consulting the public, making biotechnology companies liable for any damage, and making a test available to detect GM produce as being particularly important preconditions for maintaining trust in the regulation of agricultural biotechnology.}},

    abstract = {{Theoretical models suggest that social networks influence the evolution of cooperation, but to date there have been few experimental studies. Observational data suggest that a wide variety of behaviors may spread in human social networks, but subjects in such studies can choose to befriend people with similar behaviors, posing difficulty for causal inference. Here, we exploit a seminal set of laboratory experiments that originally showed that voluntary costly punishment can help sustain cooperation. In these experiments, subjects were randomly assigned to a sequence of different groups to play a series of single-shot public goods games with strangers; this feature allowed us to draw networks of interactions to explore how cooperative and uncooperative behaviors spread from person to person to person. We show that, in both an ordinary public goods game and in a public goods game with punishment, focal individuals are influenced by fellow group members' contribution behavior in future interactions with other individuals who were not a party to the initial interaction. Furthermore, this influence persists for multiple periods and spreads up to three degrees of separation (from person to person to person to person). The results suggest that each additional contribution a subject makes to the public good in the first period is tripled over the course of the experiment by other subjects who are directly or indirectly influenced to contribute more as a consequence. These results show experimentally that cooperative behavior cascades in human social networks.}},

@article{howard1966,
    abstract = {{The information theory developed by Shannon was designed to place a quantitative measure on the amount of information involved in any communication. The early developers stressed that the information measure was dependent only on the probabilistic structure of the communication process. For example, if losing all your assets in the stock market and having whale steak for supper have the same probability, then the information associated with the occurrence of either event is the same. Attempts to apply Shannon's information theory to problems beyond communications have, in the large, come to grief. The failure of these attempts could have been predicted because no theory that involves just the probabilities of outcomes without considering their consequences could possibly be adequate in describing the importance of uncertainty to a decision maker. It is necessary to be concerned not only with the probabilistic nature of the uncertainties that surround us, but also with the economic impact that these uncertainties will have on us. In this paper the theory of the value of information that arises from considering jointly the probabilistic and economic factors that affect decisions is discussed and illustrated. It is found that numerical values can be assigned to the elimination or reduction of any uncertainty. Furthermore, it is seen that the joint elimination of the uncertainty about a number of even independent factors in a problem can have a value that differs from the sum of the values of eliminating the uncertainty in each factor separately.}},

In this study we examined how the influence of  ” elite” vs.  ” common” users changed over time in Wikipedia. The results suggest that although Wikipedia was driven by the influence of  ” elite” users early on, more recently there has been a dramatic shift in workload to the  ” common” user. We also show the same shift in del.icio.us, a very different type of social collaborative knowledge system. We discuss how these results mirror the dynamics found in more traditional social collectives, and how they can influence the design of new collaborative knowledge systems.}},

Previous work has shown that a small fraction of editors --Wikipedians -- do most of the work and produce most of the value. Other work has offered conjectures about how Wikipedians differ from other editors and how Wikipedians change over time. We quantify and test these conjectures. Our key findings include: Wikipedians' edits last longer; Wikipedians invoke community norms more often to justify their edits; on many dimensions of activity, Wikipedians start intensely, tail off a little, then maintain a relatively high level of activity over the course of their career. Finally, we show that the amount of work done by Wikipedians and non-Wikipedians differs significantly from their very first day. Our results suggest a design opportunity: customizing the initial user experience to improve retention and channel new users' intense energy.}},

The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.}},

One downside of this is that firms can experience negative publicity and financial damage if their data are breached. This is particularly the case in the medical sector, where we find empirical evidence that increased digitization of patient data is associated with more data breaches. The encryption of customer data is often presented as a potential solution, because encryption acts as a disincentive for potential malicious hackers, and can minimize the risk of breached data being put to malicious use. However, encryption both requires careful data management policies to be successful and does not ward off the insider threat. Indeed, we find no empirical evidence of a decrease in publicized instances of data loss associated with the use of encryption. Instead, there are actually increases in the cases of publicized data loss due to internal fraud or loss of computer equipment. {\copyright} 2011 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.}},

The paper uses data from a randomized field experiment that examined the relative effectiveness of personalizing ad copy to mesh with existing personal information on a social networking website. The website gave users more control over their personally identifiable information in the middle of the field test. The website did not change how advertisers used anonymous data to target ads. After this policy change, users were twice as likely to click on personalized ads. There was no comparable change in the effectiveness of ads that did not signal that they used private information when targeting. The increase in effectiveness was larger for ads that used less commonly available private information to personalize their message. This suggests that giving users the perception of more control over their private information can be an effective strategy for advertising-supported websites.}},

This has heightened consumers' privacy concerns, leading governments to pass laws designed to protect consumer privacy by restricting the use of data and by restricting online tracking techniques used by websites. We use the responses of 3.3 million survey takers who had been randomly exposed to 9,596 online display (banner) advertising campaigns to explore how privacy regulation in the European Union (EU) has influenced advertising effectiveness. This privacy regulation restricted advertisers' ability to collect data on Web users in order to target ad campaigns. We find that, on average, display advertising became far less effective at changing stated purchase intent after the EU laws were enacted, relative to display advertising in other countries. The loss in effectiveness was more pronounced for websites that had general content (such as news sites), where non-data-driven targeting is particularly hard to do. The loss of effectiveness was also more pronounced for ads with a smaller presence on the webpage and for ads that did not have additional interactive, video, or audio features.This paper was accepted by Pradeep Chintagunta, marketing.}},

Alternatively, privacy protection may inhibit adoption if hospitals cannot benefit from easily exchanging patient information.

The effect of these mutations is to drastically reduce the set of equilibria to what we term "long-run equilibria." For \$2 \times 2\$ symmetric games with two symmetric strict Nash equilibria the equilibrium selected satisfies (for large populations) Harsanyi and Selten's (1988) criterion of risk-dominance.

    abstract = {{Tracking new topics, ideas, and  ” memes ” across the Web has been an issue of considerable interest. Recent work has developed methods for tracking topic shifts over long time scales, as well as abrupt spikes in the appearance of particular named entities. However, these approaches are less well suited to the identification of content that spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order of days — the time scale at which we perceive news and events. We develop a framework for tracking short, distinctive phrases that travel relatively intact through on-line text; developing scalable algorithms for clustering textual variants of such phrases, we identify a broad class of memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation on a daily basis. As our principal domain of study, we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle — the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a  ” heartbeat”-like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs. We also develop and analyze a mathematical model for the kinds of temporal variation that the system exhibits.}},

    abstract = {{Given a water distribution network, where should we place sensors toquickly detect contaminants? Or, which blogs should we read to avoid missing important stories?. These seemingly different problems share common structure: Outbreak detection can be modeled as selecting nodes (sensor locations, blogs) in a network, in order to detect the spreading of a virus or information asquickly as possible. We present a general methodology for near optimal sensor placement in these and related problems. We demonstrate that many realistic outbreak detection objectives (e.g., detection likelihood, population affected) exhibit the property of "submodularity". We exploit submodularity to develop an efficient algorithm that scales to large problems, achieving near optimal placements, while being 700 times faster than a simple greedy algorithm. We also derive online bounds on the quality of the placements obtained by any algorithm. Our algorithms and bounds also handle cases where nodes (sensor locations, blogs) have different costs. We evaluate our approach on several large real-world problems,including a model of a water distribution network from the EPA, andreal blog data. The obtained sensor placements are provably near optimal, providing a constant fraction of the optimal solution. We show that the approach scales, achieving speedups and savings in storage of several orders of magnitude. We also show how the approach leads to deeper insights in both applications, answering multicriteria trade-off, cost-sensitivity and generalization questions.}},

    abstract = {{Information diffusion and virus propagation are fundamental processes talking place in networks. While it is often possible to directly observe when nodes become infected, observing individual transmissions (i.e., who infects whom or who influences whom) is typically very difficult. Furthermore, in many applications, the underlying network over which the diffusions and propagations spread is actually unobserved. We tackle these challenges by developing a method for tracing paths of diffusion and influence through networks and inferring the networks over which contagions propagate. Given the times when nodes adopt pieces of information or become infected, we identify the optimal network that best explains the observed infection times. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard to solve exactly, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that scales to large datasets and in practice gives provably near-optimal performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by tracing information cascades in a set of 170 million blogs and news articles over a one year period to infer how information flows through the online media space. We find that the diffusion network of news tends to have a core-periphery structure with a small set of core media sites that diffuse information to the rest of the Web. These sites tend to have stable circles of influence with more general news media sites acting as connectors between them.}},

the recent financial and economic crisis has revealed. By identifying weak
points of conventional approaches in economics, we identify the scientific
problems which need to be addressed. We expect that solving these questions
will bring scientists in a position to give better decision support and policy
advice. We also indicate, what kinds of insights can be contributed by
scientists from other research fields such as physics, biology, computer and
social science. In order to make a quick progress and gain a systemic
understanding of the whole interconnected socio-economic-environmental system,
using the data, information and computer systems available today and in the

    abstract = {{Organizational theorists have built a deep understanding of the conditions affecting knowledge sharing. However, for innovation to occur, knowledge must not just be shared, but also reused, recombined, and accumulated. Such accumulation is not inherent to the innovation process but can be either supported or limited by the context in which it occurs. We propose a framework arguing that three conditions shape this context: disclosure, access, and rewards. We show how these conditions operate at the institutional, field, community, and organizational levels. Our framework highlights how when innovators encounter barriers to the accumulation of knowledge, their solutions are often organizational ones rather than legal ones. This suggests an expanding terrain for organizational scholars interested in debates often dominated by law and economics.}},

    abstract = {{We investigate if the actions by individuals in creating effective new innovations are aligned with the reuse of those innovations by others in a private-collective software development context.  This  relationship is studied in the setting of eleven  ” wiki-like” programming contests, where contest submissions are open for reuse by others, each involving more than one hundred contributors and several thousand attempts to generate, over a one-week period, the  ” best” software solution to a difficult programming challenge.  We find that greater amounts of new code and novel recombinations of others' code, in a contest submission, increases both the probability of achieving top rank and the subsequent reuse by others in their own submission (community value).  While, increasing use of borrowed code in a submission reduces the probability of achieving top rank, but increases the community value of the submission. Code structures that are more non-conforming to commonly accepted programming conventions similarly increase the probability of generating a top performer, but reduce subsequent reuse by others. Surprisingly, greater code complexity in a submission increases both the odds of generating a top performing entry and its community value. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of the literature on private-collective innovation with an emphasis on the importance of considering both individual and community perspectives as they relate to knowledge creation, reuse and recombination for innovation.}},

The article distinguishes between project spillovers and contributors' spillovers and between direct and indirect spillovers. The article constructs a unique data set of open source software projects. The data identify the contributors who work on each project and thus enable us to construct a two-mode network: a project network and a contributor network. The article demonstrates that the structure of these networks is associated with project success and that there is a positive association between project closeness centrality and project success. This suggests the existence of both direct and indirect project knowledge spillovers. We find no evidence for any association between contributor closeness centrality and project success, suggesting that contributor spillovers play a lesser role in project success.}},

Subjects under such an incentive scheme explore more and are more likely to discover a novel business strategy than subjects under fixed-wage and standard pay-for-performance incentive schemes. We also find evidence that the threat of termination can undermine incentives for innovation, while golden parachutes can alleviate these innovation-reducing effects.

    abstract = {{Many projects have tried to analyze the structure and dynamics of application overlay networks on the Internet using packet analysis and network flow data. While such analysis is essential for a variety of network management and security tasks, it is infeasible on many networks: either the volume of data is so large as to make packet inspection intractable, or privacy concerns forbid packet capture and require the dissociation of network flows from users' actual IP addresses. Our analytical framework permits useful analysis of network usage patterns even under circumstances where the only available source of data is anonymized flow records. Using this data, we are able to uncover distributions and scaling relations in host-to-host networks that bear implications for capacity planning and network application design. We also show how to classify network applications based entirely on topological properties of their overlay networks, yielding a taxonomy that allows us to accurately identify the functions of unknown applications. We repeat this analysis on a more recent dataset, allowing us to demonstrate that the aggregate behavior of users is remarkably stable even as the population changes.}},

Queueing theory is believed to provide a generic answer to account for the often observed power-law distributions of waiting times before a task is fulfilled. However, the general validity of the power law and the nature of other regimes remain unsettled. Using anonymized data collected by Google at the World Wide Web level, we identify the existence of several additional regimes characterizing the time required for a population of Internet users to execute a given task after receiving a message. Depending on the under- or over-utilization of time by the population of users and the strength of their response to perturbations, the pure power law is found to be coextensive with an exponential regime (tasks are performed without too much delay) and with a crossover to an asymptotic plateau (some tasks are never performed).}},

    abstract = {{This paper reports data from a study that seeks to characterize the differences in design structure between complex software products. We use design structure matrices (DSMs) to map dependencies between the elements of a design and define metrics that allow us to compare the structures of different designs. We use these metrics to compare the architectures of two software products--the Linux operating system and the Mozilla Web browser--that were developed via contrasting modes of organization: specifically, open source versus proprietary development. We then track the evolution of Mozilla, paying attention to a purposeful "redesign" effort undertaken with the intention of making the product more "modular." We find significant differences in structure between Linux and the first version of Mozilla, suggesting that Linux had a more modular architecture. Yet we also find that the redesign of Mozilla resulted in an architecture that was significantly more modular than that of its predecessor and, indeed, than that of Linux. Our results, while exploratory, are consistent with a view that different modes of organization are associated with designs that possess different structures. However, they also suggest that purposeful managerial actions can have a significant impact in adapting a design's structure. This latter result is important given recent moves to release proprietary software into the public domain. These moves are likely to fail unless the product possesses an "architecture for participation."}},

@article{grundfest2006,
    abstract = {{In this Article, we suggest that litigation can be analyzed as though it is a competitive research and development project. Developing this analogy, we present a two-stage real option model of the litigation process that involves sequential information revelation and bargaining over the surplus generated by early settlement. Litigants are risk-neutral and have no private information. The model generates results that, we believe, have analytic and normative significance for the economic analysis of litigation.

From an analytic perspective, we demonstrate that negative expected value (NEV) lawsuits are analogous to out of the money call options held by plaintiffs and that every NEV lawsuit is credible if the variance of the information revealed during the course of the litigation is sufficiently large. This finding helps explain the prevalence of a class of lawsuits that has proved puzzling to traditional, expected value-based modes of litigation analysis. The model also suggests that risk-neutral defendants can act as though they are risk-averse and that risk-neutral plaintiffs can act as though they are risk-seeking because increases in variance can increase a lawsuit's settlement option value just as it increases a call option's value without regard to the holder's degree of risk aversion. Models that presume defendants' relative risk aversion may therefore rely on an unnecessary assumption. Our model also suggests that a lawsuit's option settlement value is not a monotonically increasing function of the variance of the information revealed during the litigation. In particular, at low levels of variance a lawsuit's option settlement value may equal its traditional expected value, but as variance increases its option settlement value can display a discontinuity after which its option settlement value becomes a monotonically increasing function of variance. NEV lawsuits can also display "dead zones" - regions of variance over which the claim is not credible even though it is credible over higher or lower levels of variance. Comparative statics analysis also quantifies the extent to which a lawsuit's settlement value increases as plaintiff's litigation expenses occur later in the litigation process, as the ratio of defendant-to-plaintiff litigation expense increases and as plaintiff bargaining power increases.

From a normative perspective, we offer an "impossibility conjecture" suggesting that the mere presence of an irreducible degree of uncertainty endemic to the litigation process can be sufficient to prevent private litigation incentives from equating to socially optimal incentives, even if one adopts all other assumptions necessary to equate private and social incentives. It follows that it may be impossible to articulate normative principles of law through substantive standards that ignore the uncertainty inherent in the litigation process and the procedural environment in which the litigation occurs.}},

Central to the theory is analysis of the mechanisms through which knowledge is integrated within firms in order to create capability. The theory is used to explore firms' potential for establishing competitive advantage in dynamic market settings, including the role of firm networks under conditions of unstable linkages between knowledge inputs and product outputs. The analysis points to the difficulties in creating the "dynamic" and "flexible-response capabilities" which have been deemed critical to success in hypercompetitive markets.}},

Thanks to frequent changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the associated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution. Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and self-optimization of society as a whole. We have developed an algorithm based on clique percolation that allows us to investigate the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale, and thus uncover basic relationships characterizing community evolution. Our focus is on networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist for longer if they are capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to change the group composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small groups displays the opposite tendency-the condition for stability is that their composition remains unchanged. We also show that knowledge of the time commitment of members to a given community can be used for estimating the community's lifetime. These findings offer insight into the fundamental differences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.}},

The potential for organizing depends on the social ties in the group, particularly on the overall density or frequency of ties, on the extent to which they are centralized in a few individuals, and on the costs of communicating and coordinating actions through these ties. Mathematical analysis and computer simulations extend a formal microsocial theory of interdependent collective action to treat social networks and organization costs. As expected, the overall density of social ties in a group improves its prospects for collective action. More significant, because less expected, are the findings that show that the centralization of network ties always has a positive effect on collective action and that the negative effect of costs on collective action declines as the group's resource or interest heterogeneity increases. These nonobvious results are due to the powerful effects of selectivity, the organizer's ability to concentrate organizing efforts on those individuals whose potential contributions are the largest.}},

natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data

models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market

models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the
following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways--
both successful and unsuccessful--of governing the commons. In contrast to the
proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems
sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive
state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests,
irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.}},

    abstract = {{Tracking new topics, ideas, and "memes" across the Web has been an issue of considerable interest. Recent work has developed methods for tracking topic shifts over long time scales, as well as abrupt spikes in the appearance of particular named entities. However, these approaches are less well suited to the identification of content that spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order of days - the time scale at which we perceive news and events. We develop a framework for tracking short, distinctive phrases that travel relatively intact through on-line text; developing scalable algorithms for clustering textual variants of such phrases, we identify a broad class of memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation on a daily basis. As our principal domain of study, we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a "heartbeat"-like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs. We also develop and analyze a mathematical model for the kinds of temporal variation that the system exhibits.}},

    abstract = {{We analyze an evolutionary model with a finite number of players and with noise or mutations. The expansion and contraction of strategies is linked--as usual--to their current relative success, but mutations--which perturb the system away from its deterministic evolution--are present as well. Mutations can occur in every period, so the focus is on the implications of ongoing mutations, not a one-shot mutation. The effect of these mutations is to drastically reduce the set of equilibria to what we term "long-run equilibria." For 2 × 2 symmetric games with two symmetric strict Nash equilibria the equilibrium selected satisfies (for large populations) Harsanyi and Selten's (1988) criterion of risk-dominance. In particular, if both strategies have equal security levels, the Pareto dominant Nash equilibrium is selected, even though there is another strict Nash equilibrium.}},

    abstract = {{Motivation in the context of open source software may be seen as fundamentally different due to the presence of unpaid programmers, implicit rather than explicit forms of control and a different methodology for software development. Since software development is a creative task, the motivation of open source programmers can be compared to individuals in creative industries (Caves 2002). This paper summarizes the important trends in the research on motivation in open source and identifies variables that should be included in future research. Specifically, the current literature favors a taxonomy that considers two components of motivation—intrinsic (e.g., fun, flow, learning, community) and extrinsic (e.g., financial rewards, improving future job prospects, signaling quality). I make a case for incorporating both elements in developing an integrative theory about developer motivation. Three elements are identified as being unique to FLOSS development-diversity of project structures, co-existence of companies and communities and co-existence of creative and commercial elements. The important empirical evidence on FLOSS developer motivation is presented and analyzed. Four factors are identified as important mitigating and moderating factors in the conversation surrounding developer motivation- financial incentives, nature of task, group size and group structure. The role of these factors on developer motivation is discussed.}},

    abstract = {{Since the turn of the century, open source software has triggered a vast volume of research. In this essay, based on a brief review of selected work, we show that research in many different fields and disciplines of the social sciences have shed light on the phenomenon. We argue that five characteristics make the phenomenon particularly attractive to examination from various fields and disciplines using a plethora of research methods: (1) impact: open source software has an extensive impact on the economy and society; (2) theoretical tension: the phenomenon deviates sharply from the predictions and explanations of existing theory in different fields; (3) transparency: open source software has offered researchers an unprecedented access to data; (4) communal reflexivity: the community of open source software developers frequently engage in a dialog on its functioning (it also has its own research community); (5) proximity: the innovation process in open source software resembles knowledge production in science (in many instances, open source software is an output of research processes). These five characteristics also promote a transdisciplinary research dialog. Based on the experience of open source software research, we propose that phenomena-driven transdisciplinary research provides an excellent context to promote greater dialog between disciplines and fields. Moreover, we propose that the recent diffusion of the open source software model of innovation to other areas than software calls for new research and that the field of information systems has an important role to play in this future research agenda.}},

@article{Young1993Evolution,
    abstract = {{Consider an n-person game that is played repeatedly, but by different agents. In each period, n players are drawn at random from a large finite population. Each player chooses an optimal strategy based on a sample of information about what others players have done in the past. The sampling defines a stochastic process that, for a large class of games that includes coordination games and common interest games, converges almost surely to a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Such an equilibrium can be interpreted as the "conventional" way of playing the game. If, in addition, the players sometimes experiment or make mistakes, then society occasionally switches from one convention to another. As the likelihood of mistakes goes to zero, only some conventions (equilibria) have positive probability in the limit. These are known as stochastically stable equilibria. They are essentially the same as the risk dominant equilibria in 2 × 2 games, but for general games the two concepts differ. The stochastically stable equilibria are computed by finding a path of least resistance from every equilibrium to every other, and then finding the equilibrium that has lowest overall resistance. This is a special case of a general theorem on perturbed Markov processes that characterizes their stochastically stable states graph-theoretically.}},

    abstract = {{Many systems in chemistry, biology, finance, and social sciences present emerging features that are not easy to guess from the elementary interactions of their microscopic individual components. In the past, the macroscopic behavior of such systems was modeled by assuming that the collective dynamics of microscopic components can be effectively described collectively by equations acting on spatially continuous density distributions. It turns out that, to the contrary, taking into account the actual individual/discrete character of the microscopic components of these systems is crucial for explaining their macroscopic behavior. In fact, we find that in conditions in which the continuum approach would predict the extinction of all of the population (respectively the vanishing of the invested capital or the concentration of a chemical substance, etc.), the microscopic granularity insures the emergence of macroscopic localized subpopulations with collective adaptive properties that allow their survival and development. In particular it is found that in two dimensions  ” life” (the localized proliferating phase) always prevails.}},

    abstract = {{Disclosure has long been the preferred regulatory approach to curtail one-sided standard form contract terms. Examples include the Truth in Lending Act, the new "ALI Principles of the Law of Software Contracts," and many other proposals which await Congressional approval. The appeal of disclosure is that it is relatively low cost, improves consumer decision-making and preserves consumer choice. For disclosure to be effective, however, it must increase readership and understanding of contracts to a meaningful rate, and, conditional on readership, contract content must be relevant to purchase decisions. This paper tests both these necessary conditions. We follow the clickstream of 47,399 households to 81 Internet software retailers to measure contract readership as a function of disclosure. We find that making contracts more prominently available does not increase readership in any significant way. In addition, the purchasing behavior of those few consumers who read contracts is unaffected by the one-sidedness of their terms. The results suggest that mandating disclosure online should not on its own be expected to have large effects on contract content.}},

    abstract = {{With millions of home and service robots already on the market, and millions more on the way, robotics is poised to be the next transformative technology.  As with personal computers, personal robots are more likely to thrive if they are sufficiently open to third-party contributions of software and hardware.  No less than with telephony, cable, computing, and the Internet, an open robotics could foster innovation, spur consumer adoption, and create secondary markets.But open robots also present the potential for inestimable legal liability, which may lead entrepreneurs and investors to abandon open robots in favor of products with more limited functionality.  This possibility flows from a key difference between personal computers and robots.  Like PCs, open robots have no set function, run third-party software, and invite modification.  But unlike PCs, personal robots are in a position directly to cause physical damage and injury.  Thus, norms against suit and expedients to limit liability such as the economic loss doctrine are unlikely to transfer from the PC and consumer software context to that of robotics.This essay therefore recommends a selective immunity for manufacturers of open robotic platforms for what end users do with these platforms, akin to the immunity enjoyed under federal law by firearms manufacturers and websites.  Selective immunity has the potential to preserve the conditions for innovation without compromising incentives for safety.  The alternative is to risk being left behind in a key technology by countries with a higher bar to litigation and a serious head start.}},

    abstract = {{Four hundred seventy-six nuclear power plants are in operation or under construction around the world. Are concepts for designing and operating plants safely sufficient? Conventional approaches are premised on expectations of predictability and control of radiation release and on assumptions that plant operations are closed systems. Field observations in the industry find, however, that the periodic necessity to refuel, test safety equipment, and continuously upgrade plant designs introduces challenges to control not originally calculated. The social and cultural contexts of markets, regulation, and work systems create additional contingencies. In this dynamic environment, reactor operations produce invaluable data about the states of the entire technology and organizational system. Rereading these dynamics as "experiments" suggests an alternative epistemology that synthesizes science's values of doubt, discovery, and documentation with engineering's values of efficiency, optimization, and problem solving. This redefines plant-based risk handlers as ethologists, geologists, and anthropologists of an ecology of visible and invisible hazards.}},

@article{bodo2011,
    abstract = {{Wikileaks represents a new type of (h)activism, which shifts the source of potential threat from a few, dangerous hackers and a larger group of mostly harmless activists – both outsiders to an organization – to those who are on the inside. For insiders trying to smuggle information out, anonymity is a necessary condition for participation. Wikileaks has demonstrated that the access to anonymity can be democratized, made simple and user friendly. Being Anonymous in the context of Wikileaks has a double promise: it promises to liberate the subject from the existing power structures, and in the same time it allows the exposure of these structures by opening up a space to confront them. The Wikileaks coerced transparency, however, is nothing more than the extension of the Foucauldian disciplinary power to the very body of state and government. While anonymity removes the individual from existing power relations, the act of surveillance puts her right back to the middle.The ability to place the state under surveillance limits and ultimately renders present day sovereignty obsolete. It can also be argued that it fosters the emergence of a new sovereign in itself. I believe that Wikileaks (or rather, the logic of it) is a new sovereign in the global political/economic sphere. But as it stands now, Wikileakistan shares too much with the powers it wishes to counter. The hidden power structures and the inner workings of these states within the state are exposed by another imperium in imperio, a secretive organization, whose agenda is far from transparent, whose members, resources are unknown, holding back an indefinite amount of information both on itself and on its opponents.I argue that it is not more secretive, one sided transparency which will subvert and negate the control and discipline of secretive, one sided transparency, it is anonymity. The subject's position of being  ” a multiplicity that can be numbered and supervised”, its state of living in a  ” sequestered and observed solitude” (Foucault 1979) can only be subverted if there is a place to hide from surveillance. I argue that maybe less, and not more transparency is the path that leads to the aims of Wikileaks.}},

It provides an overview of some of the key challenges surrounding the so-called nuclear renaissance. It provides a broad context for the more specific concerns with the social and political aspects of radioactive waste which will be considered in the next issue. What are the likely consequences of a global nuclear power renaissance? This article answers that question by exploring six categories of costs and benefits associated with modern nuclear power plants: capital and production costs, safety and reliability, fuel costs, land degradation, water use, and greenhouse gas emissions. After weighing arguments on both sides, when costs and benefits are normalized across studies and different reactor types, the article finds that the typical nuclear power plant has 8.6 cents of damages attached to every kilowatt-hour of electricity it produces, and the industry as a whole has \$223.7 billion worth of net damages every year. These costs are so large (and unavoidable) that in most countries investments in nuclear power do not occur, and they raise doubts as to whether a nuclear renaissance will produce net benefits to society.}},

    abstract = {{Open Source Software (OSS) development is often characterized as a fundamentally new way to develop software. Past analyses and discussions, however, have treated OSS projects and their organization mostly as a static phenomenon. Consequently, we do not know how these communities of software developers are sustained and reproduced over time through the progressive integration of new members. To shed light on this issue I report on my analyses of socialization in a particular OSS community. In particular, I document the relationships OSS newcomers develop over time with both the social and material aspects of a project. To do so, I combine two mutually informing activities: ethnography and the use of software specially designed to visualize and explore the interacting networks of human and material resources incorporated in the email and code databases of OSS. Socialization in this community is analyzed from two perspectives: as an individual learning process and as a political process. From these analyses it appears that successful participants progressively construct identities as software craftsmen, and that this process is punctuated by specific rites of passage. Successful participants also understand the political nature of software development and progressively enroll a network of human and material allies to support their efforts. I conclude by discussing how these results could inform the design of software to support socialization in OSS projects, as well as practical implications for the future of these projects.}},

the different options available to you. This concise guide focuses on
annotated licenses, offering an in-depth explanation of how they compare and
interoperate, and how license choices affect project possibilities. Written in
clear language that you don't have to be a lawyer to understand, the book
answers such questions as: What rights am I giving up? How will my use of
OS/FS licensing affect future users or future developers? Does a particular
use of this software--such as combining it with proprietary software--leave me
vulnerable to lawsuits?

Following a quick look at copyright law, contracts, and the definition of
"open source," the book tackles the spectrum of licensing, including:

The MIT (or X), BSD, Apache and Academic Free licenses

The GPL, LGPL, and Mozilla licenses

The QT, Artistic, and Creative Commons licenses

Classic Proprietary licenses

Sun Community Source license and Microsoft Shared Source project

The book wraps up with a look at the legal effects--both positive and negative
--of open source/free software licensing.

Licensing is a major part of what open source and free software are all about,
but it's still one of the most complicated areas of law. Even the very simple
licenses are tricky. Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing
bridges the gap between the open source vision and the practical implications
of its legal underpinnings. If open source and free software licenses interest
you, this book will help you understand them. If you're an open source/free
software developer, this book is an absolute necessity.}},

    abstract = {{This article is an initial exploration of the determinants of open source license choice. It first highlights how the decision is shaped not just by the preferences of the licensor itself, but also by that of the community of developers. The article then presents an empirical analysis of the determinants of license choice using the SourceForge database, a compilation of nearly 40,000 open source projects. Projects geared toward end-users tend to have restrictive licenses, while those oriented toward developers are less likely to do so. Projects that are designed to run on commercial operating systems and whose primary language is English are less likely to have restrictive licenses. Projects that are likely to be attractive to consumers—such as games—and software developed in a corporate setting are more likely to have restrictive licenses. Projects with unrestricted licenses attract more contributors. These findings are broadly consistent with theoretical predictions.}},

We first show that, without some kind of coordination, production of the public knowledge good (science or research software or database) is sub-optimal. Then we demonstrate that if 'lead' researchers are able to establish a norm of contribution to the public good, a better outcome can be achieved, and we show that the general public license (GPL) used in the provision of open source software is one such mechanism. Our results are then applied to the specific setting where the knowledge being produced is software or a database that will be used by academic researchers and possibly by private firms, using as an example a product familiar to economists, econometric software. We conclude by discussing some of the ways in which pricing can ameliorate the problem of providing these products to academic researchers.}},

Most projects carefully regulate admission of outsiders to full developer privileges; some projects even have formal descriptions of this process. Understanding the factors that influence the "who, how and when" of this process is critical, both for the sustainability of FLOSS projects, and for outside stakeholders who want to gain entry and succeed. In this paper we mount a quantitative case study of the process by which people join FLOSS projects, using data mined from the Apache web server, Postgres, and Python.

Any structure that exists is dynamic, self-organizing, latent, and usually not explicitly stated. Still, in large, complex, successful, OSS projects, we do expect that subcommunities will form spontaneously within the developer teams. Studying these subcommunities, and their behavior can shed light on how successful OSS projects self-organize. This phenomenon could well hold important lessons for how commercial software teams might be organized. Building on known well-established techniques for detecting community structure in complex networks, we extract and study latent subcommunities from the email social network of several projects: Apache HTTPD, Python, PostgresSQL, Perl, and Apache ANT. We then validate them with software development activity history. Our results show that subcommunities do indeed spontaneously arise within these projects as the projects evolve. These subcommunities manifest most strongly in technical discussions, and are significantly connected with collaboration behaviour.}},

This dichotomy was first identified in the early work of Ronald Coase and was developed most explicitly in the work of institutional economist Oliver Williamson. Recently, public attention has focused on a fifteen-year-old phenomenon called free software or open source software. This phenomenon involves thousands, or even tens of thousands, of computer programmers who collaborate on large- and small-scale projects without traditional firm-based or market-based ownership of the resulting product.

Finally, we introduce a simulation model that captures how vulnerability discoveries may be placed in a dual legal-black market context. We perform simulations and find that if legal markets expose vulnerabilities that go unresolved, the security and quality of software may suffer more than in the absence of a legal market.

    abstract = {{The dynamics of many social, technological and economic phenomena are driven by individual human actions, turning the quantitative understanding of human behavior into a central question of modern science. Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes. Here we provide direct evidence that for five human activity patterns, such as email and letter based communications, web browsing, library visits and stock trading, the timing of individual human actions follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity. We show that the bursty nature of human behavior is a consequence of a decision based queuing process: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, most tasks being rapidly executed, while a few experiencing very long waiting times. In contrast, priority blind execution is well approximated by uniform interevent statistics. We discuss two queuing models that capture human activity. The first model assumes that there are no limitations on the number of tasks an individual can hadle at any time, predicting that the waiting time of the individual tasks follow a heavy tailed distribution P(τw)∼τw−α with α=3∕2. The second model imposes limitations on the queue length, resulting in a heavy tailed waiting time distribution characterized by α=1. We provide empirical evidence supporting the relevance of these two models to human activity patterns, showing that while emails, web browsing and library visitation display α=1, the surface mail based communication belongs to the α=3∕2 universality class. Finally, we discuss possible extension of the proposed queuing models and outline some future challenges in exploring the statistical mechanics of human dynamics.}},

    abstract = {{The dynamics of many social, technological and economic phenomena are driven by individual human actions, turning the quantitative understanding of human behavior into a central question of modern science. Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes. In contrast, there is increasing evidence that the timing of many human activities, ranging from communication to entertainment and work patterns, follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity. Here we show that the bursty nature of human behavior is a consequence of a decision based queuing process: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, most tasks being rapidly executed, while a few experience very long waiting times. In contrast, priority blind execution is well approximated by uniform interevent statistics. These findings have important implications from resource management to service allocation in both communications and retail.}},

Using these performance metrics, we consider the ability of different response techniques to degrade or dis- rupt botnets. In particular, our models show that targeted responses are particularly effective against scale free botnets and ef- forts to increase the robustness of scale free networks comes at a cost of diminished transitivity. Botmasters do not ap- pear to have any structural solutions to this problem in scale free networks. We also show that random graph bot- nets (e.g., those using P2P formations) are highly resistant to both random and targeted responses. We evaluate the impact of responses on different topolo- gies using simulation and demonstrate the utility of our pro- posed metrics by performing novel measurements of a P2P network. Our analysis shows how botnets may be classified according to structure and given rank or priority using our proposed metrics. This may help direct responses and sug- gests which general remediation strategies are more likely to succeed.}},

Most technologists acknowledge this undertaking's importance, but they need some help in understanding how to tackle it. The article aims to provide that help by exploring software security best practices. A central and critical aspect of the computer security problem is a software problem. Software defects with security ramifications, including implementation bugs such as buffer overflows and design flaws such as inconsistent error handling, promise to be with us for years. All too often, malicious intruders can hack into systems by exploiting software defects. Internet-enabled software applications present the most common security risk encountered today, with software's ever-expanding complexity and extensibility adding further fuel to the fire. By any measure, security holes in software are common, and the problem is growing.}},

    abstract = {{Work on security vulnerabilities in software has primarily focused on three points in the software life-cycle: (1) finding and removing software defects, (2) patching or hardening software after vulnerabilities have been discovered, and (3) measuring the rate of vulnerability exploitation. This paper examines an earlier period in the software vulnerability life-cycle, starting from the release date of a version through to the disclosure of the fourth vulnerability, with a particular focus on the time from release until the very first disclosed vulnerability. Analysis of software vulnerability data, including up to a decade of data for several versions of the most popular operating systems, server applications and user applications (both open and closed source), shows that properties extrinsic to the software play a much greater role in the rate of vulnerability discovery than do intrinsic properties such as software quality. This leads us to the observation that (at least in the first phase of a product's existence), software vulnerabilities have different properties from software defects. We show that the length of the period after the release of a software product (or version) and before the discovery of the first vulnerability (the 'Honeymoon' period) is primarily a function of familiarity with the system. In addition, we demonstrate that legacy code resulting from code re-use is a major contributor to both the rate of vulnerability discovery and the numbers of vulnerabilities found; this has significant implications for software engineering principles and practice.}},

can occur through individual learning or through natural selection, the basis
of evolution. Since the work of Maynard Smith and others, it has been realized
how game theory can model this process. Evolutionary game theory replaces the
static solutions of classical game theory by a dynamical approach centered not
on the concept of rational players but on the population dynamics of
behavioral programs. In this book the authors investigate the nonlinear
dynamics of the self-regulation of social and economic behavior, and of the
closely related interactions among species in ecological communities.
Replicator equations describe how successful strategies spread and thereby
create new conditions that can alter the basis of their success, i.e., to
enable us to understand the strategic and genetic foundations of the endless
chronicle of invasions and extinctions that punctuate evolution. In short,
evolutionary game theory describes when to escalate a conflict, how to elicit
cooperation, why to expect a balance of the sexes, and how to understand
natural selection in mathematical terms.}},

    abstract = {{Empirical analyses show that after the update of a browser, or the publication of the vulnerability of a software, or the discovery of a cyber worm, the fraction of computers still using the older browser or software version, or not yet patched, or exhibiting worm activity decays as a power law ∼1/tα with 0<α≤1 over a time scale of years. We present a simple model for this persistence phenomenon, framed within the standard priority queuing theory, of a target task which has the lowest priority compared to all other tasks that flow on the computer of an individual. We identify a  ” time deficit” control parameter β and a bifurcation to a regime where there is a nonzero probability for the target task to never be completed. The distribution of waiting time T until the completion of the target task has the power law tail ∼1/t1/2, resulting from a first-passage solution of an equivalent Wiener process. Taking into account a diversity of time deficit parameters in a population of individuals, the power law tail is changed into 1/tα, with α∊(0.5,∞), including the well-known case 1/t. We also study the effect of  ” procrastination,” defined as the situation in which the target task may be postponed or delayed even after the individual has solved all other pending tasks. This regime provides an explanation for even slower apparent decay and longer persistence.}},

The interplay between effort and discovery is clear, and the nature of the functional form has been thought to be due to many changes in the scientific process over time. Here I show a quantitative method for examining the ease of scientific progress, another necessary component in understanding scientific discovery. Using examples from three different scientific disciplines—mammalian species, chemical elements, and minor planets—I find the ease of discovery to conform to an exponential decay. In addition, I show how the pace of scientific discovery can be best understood as the outcome of both scientific output and ease of discovery. A quantitative study of the ease of scientific discovery in the aggregate, such as done here, has the potential to provide a great deal of insight into both the nature of future discoveries and the technical processes behind discoveries in science.}},

Such structures are uncovered by a general information theoretic approach to dynamic networks based on the analysis of synchronization among trios of users. In the e-mail network, coherent structures arise from temporal correlations when users act in a synchronized manner. These temporally linked structures turn out to be functional, goal-oriented aggregates that must react in real time to changing objectives and challenges (e.g., committees at a university). In contrast, static structures turn out to be related to organizational units (e.g., departments).}},

    abstract = {{10.1073/pnas.0510673103 Thoughts and ideas are multidimensional and often concurrent, yet they can be expressed surprisingly well sequentially by the translation into language. This reduction of dimensions occurs naturally but requires memory and necessitates the existence of correlations, e.g., in written text. However, correlations in word appearance decay quickly, while previous observations of long-range correlations using random walk approaches yield little insight on memory or on semantic context. Instead, we study combinations of words that a reader is exposed to within a  ” window of attention,” spanning about 100 words. We define a vector space of such word combinations by looking at words that co-occur within the window of attention, and analyze its structure. Singular value decomposition of the co-occurrence matrix identifies a basis whose vectors correspond to specific topics, or  ” concepts” that are relevant to the text. As the reader follows a text, the  ” vector of attention” traces out a trajectory of directions in this  ” concept space.” We find that memory of the direction is retained over long times, forming power-law correlations. The appearance of power laws hints at the existence of an underlying hierarchical network. Indeed, imposing a hierarchy similar to that defined by volumes, chapters, paragraphs, etc. succeeds in creating correlations in a surrogate random text that are identical to those of the original text. We conclude that hierarchical structures in text serve to create long-range correlations, and use the reader's memory in reenacting some of the multidimensionality of the thoughts being expressed.}},

We conjecture that users in large part do not actually patch their Web browsers based on recommendations, perceived threats, or any security warnings. Based on HTTP useragent header information stored in anonymized logs from Google's web servers, we measured the patch dynamics of about 75\% of the world's Internet users for over a year. Our focus was on the Web browsers Firefox and Opera. We found that the patch level achieved is mainly determined by the ergonomics and default settings of built-in auto-update mechanisms. Firefox' auto-update is very effective: most users installed a new version within three days. However, the maximum share of the latest, most secure version never exceeded 80\% for Firefox users and 46\% for Opera users at any day in 2007. This makes about 50 million Firefox users with outdated browsers an easy target for attacks.

    abstract = {{Global Internet penetration and e-commerce have grown explosively over the past years. Today, information technology has become a backbone of our industry and everyday life. We would intuitively expect such an important technology to be well monitored and protected. However, no one would dispute that the constant discovery of new vulnerabilities drives the security risks we are constantly exposed to. As risk awareness is an essential factor in human decision making, we are in need of metrics to measure and monitor the risk exposure of our networked economy and society. Research on the economic consequences of cyber attacks has dealt primarily with microanalysis of specific events, technologies or targeted organizations. The measurement of the cumulated number of disclosed vulnerabilities over time is an interesting and often cited indicator of the increasing risk exposure. However, this measure alone is not sufficient for an analysis or understanding of the processes driving risk exposure. Accurate knowledge of the vulnerability discovery-, exploit-, disclosure-, and patch-time (the lifecycle of a vulnerability) allows one to identify different types of risk and to quantify the risk exposure and evolution thereof at global scale. A metric based on the vulnerability lifecycle is vital to better understand the security ecosystem. We build a comprehensive dataset of 30,000 vulnerabilities publicly disclosed since 1996 to reconstruct the vulnerability lifecycle. Based on this data we analyze the risk exposure and evolution thereof from a macroeconomic perspective.}},

Defending against large scale attacks requires a quantitative understanding of the vulnerability lifecycle. Specifically, one has to understand how exploitation and remediation of vulnerabilities, as well as the distribution of information thereof is handled by industry.In this paper, we examine how vulnerabilities are handled in large-scale, analyzing more than 80,000 security advisories published since 1995. Based on this information, we quantify the performance of the security industry as a whole. We discover trends and discuss their implications. We quantify the gap between exploit and patch availability and provide an analytical representation of our data which lays the foundation for further analysis and risk management.}},

Power laws appear widely in physics, biology, earth and planetary sciences, economics and finance, computer science, demography and the social sciences. For instance, the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, forest fires, solar flares, moon craters and people's personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws.

@article{Clauset2009Powerlaw,
    abstract = {{Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and
have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made
phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is
complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the
distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events
-- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior
holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as
least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of
parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods
return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no
indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a
principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law
behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting
methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic
and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests
on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also
apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of
different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law
distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the
data while in others the power law is ruled out.}},

@article{Bazant1993Scaling,
    abstract = {{Scaling laws are the most fundamental aspect of every physical theory. Recently, the problem of scaling law and size effect in the theories of structural failure has received considerable attention, particularly with regard to distributed damage and nonlinear fracture behavior. The paper presents a rigorous mathematical analysis of scaling in various types of failure theories in structural mechanics. First it is shown that the scaling law is a power law if, and only if, a characteristic dimension is absent. For all the theories in which the failure condition is expressed in terms of stress or strain only, including elasticity with a strength limit, plasticity, and continuum damage mechanics, the nominal strength of the structure is shown to be independent of its size. For linear-elastic fracture mechanics, in which the failure criterion is expressed in terms of energy per unit area, the scaling law for the nominal strength is shown to be (size)\&\#150;1/2, provided that the cracks in structures of different sizes are geometrically similar. When the failure condition involves both the stress (or strain) and the energy per unit area, which is typical of quasibrittle materials, the scaling law represents a gradual transition from the strength theory, which is asymptotically approached for very small sizes, to LEFM, which is asymptotically approached for very large sizes. The size effect described by Weibull statistical theory of random material strength is also considered, and the reasons for its inapplicability to quasibrittle materials are explained. Finally, floating elastic plates with large bending fractures and a negligible process-zone size are shown to exhibit an anomalous scaling law, such that the nominal strength is proportional to (size)\&\#150;3/8, and another anomalous size effect of the type (size)\&\#150;2/5, pertinent to one recent theory of borehole breakout, is pointed out.}},

This makes their "tax haven business" more profitable and shifts a larger share of rents to these remaining tax havens, making them more reluctant to give up their "tax haven business".

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.}},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.}},

Unfortunately, these distributions consist of thousands or even millions of data points. This makes tracking, storing and visualizing changes over time a difficult task. A standard technique for capturing and describing distributions in a compact form is the Shannon entropy analysis. Its use for detecting network anomalies has been studied in-depth and several anomaly detection approaches have applied it with considerable success. However, reducing the information about a distribution to a single number deletes important information such as the nature of the change or it might lead to overlooking a large amount of anomalies entirely. In this paper, we show that a generalized form of entropy is better suited to capture changes in traffic features, by exploring different moments. We introduce the Traffic Entropy Spectrum (TES) to analyze changes in traffic feature distributions and demonstrate its ability to characterize the structure of anomalies using traffic traces from a large ISP.}},

    abstract = {{With the development of the Internet, new kinds of massive epidemics, distributed attacks, virtual conflicts and criminality have emerged. We present a study of some striking statistical properties of cyber-risks that quantify the distribution and time evolution of information risks on the Internet, to understand their mechanisms, and create opportunities to mitigate, control, predict and insure them at a global scale. First, we report an exceptionnaly stable power-law tail distribution of personal identity losses per event, Pr(ID loss ≥ V) \~{} 1/Vb, with b = 0.7 ± 0.1. This result is robust against a surprising strong non-stationary growth of ID losses culminating in July 2006 followed by a more stationary phase. Moreover, this distribution is identical for different types and sizes of targeted organizations. Since b < 1, the cumulative number of all losses over all events up to time t increases faster-than-linear with time according to t1/b, suggesting that privacy, characterized by personal identities, is necessarily becoming more and more insecure. We also show the existence of a size effect, such that the largest possible ID losses per event grow faster-than-linearly as \~{}S1.3 with the organization size S. The small value b 0.7 of the power law distribution of ID losses is explained by the interplay between Zipf's law and the size effect.

This article provides a comprehensive description of this work. It focuses on
research that extracts and makes use of the concepts, relations, facts and

categories: applying Wikipedia to natural language processing; using it to
facilitate information retrieval and information extraction; and as a resource
for ontology building. The article addresses how Wikipedia is being used as is,
how it is being improved and adapted, and how it is being combined with other
structures to create entirely new resources. We identify the research groups
and individuals involved, and how their work has developed in the last few
years. We provide a comprehensive list of the open-source software they have

    abstract = {{We consider the problem of measuring user contributions to versioned, collaborative bodies of information, such as wikis. Measuring the contributions of individual authors can be used to divide revenue, to recognize merit, to award status promotions, and to choose the order of authors when citing the content. In the context of the Wikipedia, previous works on author contribution estimation have focused on two criteria: the total text created, and the total number of edits performed. We show that neither of these criteria work well: both techniques are vulnerable to manipulation, and the total-text criterion fails to reward people who polish or re-arrange the content. We consider and compare various alternative criteria that take into account the quality of a contribution, in addition to the quantity, and we analyze how the criteria differ in the way they rank authors according to their contributions. As an outcome of this study, we propose to adopt total edit longevity as a measure of author contribution. Edit longevity is resistant to simple attacks, since edits are counted towards an author's contribution only if other authors accept the contribution. Edit longevity equally rewards people who create content, and people who rearrange or polish the content. Finally, edit longevity distinguishes the people who contribute little (who have contribution close to zero) from spammers or vandals, whose contribution quickly grows negative}},

This paper describes the results of an empirical analysis of Wikipedia and discusses ways in which the Wikipedia community has evolved as it has grown. We contrast our findings with an earlier study [11] and present three main results. First, the community maintains a strong resilience to malicious editing, despite tremendous growth and high traffic. Second, the fastest growing areas of Wikipedia are devoted to coordination and organization. Finally, we focus on a particular set of pages used to coordinate work, the "Talk" pages. By manually coding the content of a subset of these pages, we find that these pages serve many purposes, notably supporting strategic planning of edits and enforcement of standard guidelines and conventions. Our results suggest that despite the potential for anarchy, the Wikipedia community places a strong emphasis on group coordination, policy, and process.}},

@article{Helmstetter2003Mainshocks,
    abstract = {{The inverse Omori law for foreshocks discovered in the 1970s states that the
rate of earthquakes prior to a mainshock increases on average as a power law \~{}
1/(t\_c-t)^p' of the time to the mainshock occurring at t\_c. Here, we show that
this law results from the direct Omori law for aftershocks describing the power
law decay \~{} 1/(t-t\_c)^p of seismicity after an earthquake, provided that any
earthquake can trigger its suit of aftershocks. In this picture, the seismic
activity at any time is the sum of the spontaneous tectonic loading and of the
activity triggered by all preceding events weighted by their corresponding
Omori law. The inverse Omori law then emerges as the expected (in a statistical
sense) trajectory of seismicity, conditioned on the fact that it leads to the
burst of seismic activity accompanying the mainshock. The often documented
apparent decrease of the b-value of the GR law at the approach to the main
shock results straightforwardly from the conditioning of the path of seismic
activity culminating at the mainshock. In the space domain, we predict that the
phenomenon of aftershock diffusion must have its mirror process reflected into
an inward migration of foreshocks towards the mainshock. In this model,
foreshock sequences are special aftershock sequences which are modified by the
condition to end up in a burst of seismicity associated with the mainshock.}},

@article{Gachter2010Initiating,
    abstract = {{Incentives to innovate are a central element of innovation theory. In the private-investment model, innovators privately fund innovation and then use intellectual property protection mechanisms to appropriate returns from these investments. In the collective-action model, public subsidy funds public goods innovations, characterized by non-rivalry and non-exclusivity in using these innovations. Recently, these models have been compounded in the private-collective innovation model where innovators privately fund public goods innovations. Private-collective innovation is illustrated in the case of open source software development. This paper contributes to the work on this model by investigating incentives that motivate innovators to share their knowledge in an initial situation, before there is a community to support the innovation process. We use game theory to predict knowledge sharing behavior in private-collective innovation, and test these predictions in a laboratory setting. The results show that knowledge sharing is a coordination game with multiple equilibria, reflecting the fragility of knowledge sharing between innovators with conflicting interests. The experimental results demonstrate important asymmetries in the fragility of knowledge sharing and, in some situations, more knowledge sharing than theoretically predicted. A behavioral analysis suggests that knowledge sharing in private-collective innovation is not only affected by material incentives, but also by social preferences such as fairness. The results offer general insights into the relationship between incentives and knowledge sharing and contribute to a better understanding of the initiation of private-collective innovation.}},

@article{Nonaka00,

Nonaka, Toyama and Konno start from the view of an organisation as an entity that creates knowledge continuously, and their goal in this article is to understand the dynamic process in which an organisation creates, maintains and exploits knowledge. They propose a model of knowledge creation consisting of three elements: (i) the SECI process, knowledge creation through the conversion of tacit and explicit knowledge; (ii) ' ba ', the shared context for knowledge creation; and (iii) knowledge assets, the inputs, outputs and moderators of the knowledge-creating process. The knowledge creation process is a spiral that grows out of these three elements; the key to leading it is dialectical thinking. The role of top management in articulating the organisation's knowledge vision is emphasised, as is the important role of middle management ('knowledge producers') in energising ba . In summary, using existing knowledge assets, an organisation creates new knowledge through the SECI process that takes place in ba , where new knowledge, once created, becomes in turn the basis for a new spiral of knowledge creation.}},

@book{vonHippel2005Democratizing,
    abstract = {{Innovation is rapidly becoming democratized. Users, aided by improvements in computer and communications technology, increasingly can develop their own new products and services. These innovating users -- both individuals and firms -- often freely share their innovations with others, creating user-innovation communities and a rich intellectual commons. In <i>Democratizing Innovation</i>, Eric von Hippel looks closely at this emerging system of user-centered innovation. He explains why and when users find it profitable to develop new products and services for themselves, and why it often pays users to reveal their innovations freely for the use of all.<br /> <br /> The trend toward democratized innovation can be seen in software and information products -- most notably in the free and open-source software movement -- but also in physical products. Von Hippel's many examples of user innovation in action range from surgical equipment to surfboards to software security features. He shows that product and service development is concentrated among "lead users," who are ahead on marketplace trends and whose innovations are often commercially attractive.<br /> <br /> Von Hippel argues that manufacturers should redesign their innovation processes and that they should systematically seek out innovations developed by users. He points to businesses -- the custom semiconductor industry is one example -- that have learned to assist user-innovators by providing them with toolkits for developing new products. User innovation has a positive impact on social welfare, and von Hippel proposes that government policies, including R\&D subsidies and tax credits, should be realigned to eliminate biases against it. The goal of a democratized user-centered innovation system, says von Hippel, is well worth striving for. An electronic version of this book is available under a Creative Commons license.}},

new technologies are good for much more than just socializing-when properly
applied, they help businesses solve pressing problems, capture dispersed and
fast-changing knowledge, highlight and leverage expertise, generate and refine
ideas, and harness the wisdom of crowds.


Most organizations, however, don't find it easy or natural to use these new
tools initially. And executives see many possible pitfalls associated with
them. Enterprise 2.0 explores these concerns, and shows how business leaders
can overcome them.


McAfee brings together case studies and examples with key concepts from
economics, sociology, computer science, consumer psychology, and management
studies and presents them all in a clear, accessible, and entertaining style.
Enterprise 2.0 is a must-have resource for all C-suite executives seeking to
make technology decisions that are simultaneously powerful, popular, and
pragmatic.}},

@article{Sornette2003Endogenous,
    abstract = {{Systems with long-range persistence and memory are shown to exhibit different precursory as well as recovery patterns in response to shocks of exogenous versus endogenous origins. By endogenous, we envision either fluctuations resulting from an underlying chaotic dynamics or from a stochastic forcing origin which may be external or be an effective coarse-grained description of the microscopic fluctuations. In this scenario, endogenous shocks result from a kind of constructive interference of accumulated fluctuations whose impacts survive longer than the large shocks themselves. As a consequence, the recovery after an endogenous shock is in general slower at early times and can be at long times either slower or faster than after an exogenous perturbation. This offers the tantalizing possibility of distinguishing between an endogenous versus exogenous cause of a given shock, even when there is no  ” smoking gun”. This could help in investigating the exogenous versus self-organized origins in problems such as the causes of major biological extinctions, of change of weather regimes and of the climate, in tracing the source of social upheaval and wars, and so on. Sornette et al., Volatility fingerprints of large stocks: endogenous versus exogenous, cond-mat/0204626 has already shown how this concept can be applied concretely to differentiate the effects on financial markets of the 11 September 2001 attack or of the coup against Gorbachev on 19 August 1991 (exogenous) from financial crashes such as October 1987 (endogenous).}},
