\mysubsubsection{Regular Community Meetings}
{\it Are regular community meetings related in some way to project governance and the ease or difficulty of a joining script?}

Looking into the data from our survey and experience as a class, It seems that regularly held meetings, do help with project governance and play a significant role in driving project progress. In the survey results, of the 19 respondents who affirmatively that their community had a clear path to contributing, 13 claimed that their communities held a regularly scheduled meeting while only 6 did not. This suggests that respondents involved in communities holding regular meetings, found the joining process to be easier, simpler, or more user friendly. Additionally, based on observations of the IPython community, regularly scheduled meetings, whether in person or remote, seem to be an important tool for decision making for medium and long term project goals. For example, the community holds a meeting along with each release, presently every six months, for core developers. The main purpose of the meeting is to create a roadmap for the next release, an important step for making progress in the project.
