\subsubsection Personal Connections

To understand whether open source collaborators actually try to know each other on a personal level, we asked them if they knew any of the collaborators to the project personally. Out of the 23 responses, 12 said that they knew other collaborators personally. Furthermore, we asked the people who knew other collaborators if they ever discussed their contributions with the others. 10 out of 12 people replied in the affirmative. 

\italic (A good followup question would have been if this personal connection helped them in any way with their contribution, but it was too late to add it)
