\section{Context}
The  UC Berkeley iSchool Open Collaboration and Peer-Production (i290m) was designed to make sure students feel a sense of achievement conforming as much as possible the spirit of open source, with its easiest and more difficult aspects. While ensuring students achieve individually and collectively the requirements for the class, the instructors have acted as much as they could as community managers letting the class self-organize and help solve conflicting issues.
