Title: Recommended Projects
Slug: projects

Students in the course are required to contribute to an existing open collaborative project.

The quintessential open collaboration project is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).
However, students may choose an open content (like Wikipedia) or open data (like OpenStreetMap) project if they desire.
They may also make non-software contributions (like documentation, design, analytics, or marketing) to a software project.

 Here are the descriptions of a number of open source projects that we encourage you to investigate for your course work.  This list has been adapted from [here](http://foss2serve.org/index.php/HFOSS_Communities).

##Mifos

From SourceForge: "Mifos is an MIS purpose-built for the microfinance industry. It provides MFIs the key functionality to better serve the poor: client management, loans & savings portfolio tracking, reporting, & social performance measurement. "

##Ushahidi

From the website: "We are a non-profit tech company that specializes in developing free and open source software for information collection, visualization and interactive mapping."

" "Ushahidi", which means "testimony" in Swahili, was a website that was initially developed to map reports of violence in Kenya after the post-election fallout at the beginning of 2008. Since then, the name "Ushahidi" has come to represent the people behind the "Ushahidi Platform". Our roots are in the collaboration of Kenyan citizen journalists during a time of crisis. The original website was used to map incidents of violence and peace efforts throughout the country based on reports submitted via the web and mobile phones. This website had 45,000 users in Kenya, and was the catalyst for us realizing there was a need for a platform based on it, which could be used by others around the world.

Since early 2008 we have grown from an ad hoc group of volunteers to a focused organization. Our current team is comprised of individuals with a wide span of experience ranging from human rights work to software development. We have also built a strong team of volunteer developers primarily in Africa, but also Europe, South America and the U.S."

## GNOME Accessibility

From the web site: "The GNOME Accessibility project develops and fosters compelling free open source accessibility solutions for graphical user interfaces. Through a worldwide community of developers and users, we continue to empower everyone, regardless of physical or mental abilities."

The GNOME Project was started in 1997 by two then university students, Miguel de Icaza and Federico Mena. Their aim: to produce a free (as in freedom) desktop environment. Since then, GNOME has grown into a hugely successful enterprise. Used by millions of people across the world, it is the most popular desktop environment for GNU/Linux and UNIX-type operating systems.

The GNOME Accessibility Team works to ensure the GNOME Desktop and the software therein can be used by everyone, regardless of age or ability. Its efforts include the Orca screen reader, the GNOME Shell magnifier, and the Accerciser testing and debugging tool, Evolution (Contact manager, address manager and calendar), Empathy (Chat client), and Nautilus (File manager).
